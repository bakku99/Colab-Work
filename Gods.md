# Gods of Malkoros

There are many gods worshipped across Malkoros, and they all appreciate worshippers; however, in order to gain the powers granted by these Gods, one must be of the desired alignment and of the Cleric, Warlock, or Paladin classes, as they all draw their magical power from a higher power.

The pantheon(s) of Malkoros are divided into several categories, including:

## [[Greater_Deities]]

These are the cosmic architects of reality, ruling over the Prime Material, Celestial realms, and beyond.

- [[Solanis]] – God of Light and Life  
- [[Therassor]] – God of Righteous Battle  
- [[Othys]] – God of Death  
- [[Atotz]] – Goddess of Luck  
- [[Hostus]] – God of Nature  
- [[Ineas]] – Goddess of Knowledge  
- [[Uztix]] – Goddess of Murder and Evil

## [[Lesser_Deities]]
Mortals who embodied their Greater Deity's teachings with such piety that they were given Ascension and granted Divinity. These would be akin to Demigods. 

## [[Elemental_Deities]]
Primordial powers over fire, water, air, earth, arcane, and shadow.

## [[Lower_Planes_Deities]]
Fiends, demons, and abyssal lords.
