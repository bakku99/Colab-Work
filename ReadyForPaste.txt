INVENTOR

A gnome sits hunched over a workbench in a room cluttered with every sort of tool, carefully drawing the final lines to an intricate rune. With a crackling hum of arcane energy, the completed rune flares with power, and she watches with a smile of pride as the golem comes to life and stands.

An ogre looms large over a dwarf, saliva sloping down its chin as it considers its hearty meal. Its growling anticipation turns into horrified roars of agony as the dwarf unloads terrifying blasts of thunderous power from a small, metal tube.

With a mighty bloom and a crackle of energy, a lone figure lands in the middle of the battlefield. As the smoke clears, a towering presence stands amidst the war-torn ruins clad in glowing, mechanical plate. The luminous visor swivels to inspect the wreckage. It raises a gauntlet, and lightning surges forth.

With a beckoning gesture, the elf summons a swirl of swords leaping from their sheaths and springing to life. The shocked bandits begin to edge away, breaking into a run as the swords exuberantly give chase.

Makers of magic-infused objects, inventors are defined by their innovative nature. Like wizards, they see magic as a complex system waiting to be decoded and controlled through a combination of thorough study and investigation. Inventors, though, focus on creating marvelous, new magical objects. Spells are often too ephemeral and temporary for their tastes. Instead, they seek to craft durable, useful items.

CUNNING CREATORS

Every inventor is defined by a specific craft. Inventors see mastering the basics of a craft as the first step towards true progress, the invention of new methods, and innovative approaches. Inventors are arcane engineers, students of invention and warfare who craft deadly firearms, ingenious gadgets, magical armor, and mechanical beings that they can augment with magic.

All inventors are united by their curious and creative nature. To an inventor, magic is an evolving art with a leading edge of discovery and mastery that pushes further ahead with each passing year.

Inventors value novelty and innovation. This penchant pushes them to seek a life of adventure.

A hidden ruin might hold a forgotten magic item or a beautifully crafted mirror perfect for magical enhancement. Inventors win respect and renown among their kind by uncovering new lore or inventing new methods of creation.

BOUNDLESS IMAGINATION

An inventor is not the sort to be limited by what already exists or by conventional wisdom. They combine all the tools at their disposal to go beyond—to discover new boundaries and promptly exceed them. Few things can stand in the path of an inventor with a mind to change the world.

Seeking to push beyond all and striving for the new is the unifying call of inventors, but how jealously they guard their secrets can vary greatly. Some push their knowledge upon the worlds, while others hoard it.

RIVALS AND CHALLENGES

Inventors often acquire rivals—other inventors racing to be the first to unlock the secrets of the world, scrambling to be the one after whom a new magical theory or scientific breakthrough will forever be named. Theft and acquisition of stolen ideas can often become an issue when too many inventors clash over a field of expertise.

Further, inventors quickly make enemies of those who would just as soon see the world unchanged.

They are often viewed as dangerous upstarts or radical troublemakers with their newfangled ways of doing things.

These challenges rarely daunt an inventor for long and most often simply fuel their continued drive to rise above. Inventors are rarely set in their ways, and the hated rival of last week may be a research associate the next.

CREATING AN INVENTOR

When creating an inventor character, think about your character’s background and drive for adventure. Does the character have a rival? What drove your character down the path of becoming an inventor? Is it about curiosity and innovation, or is it about the power their inventions bring? Did your character learn from another inventor, or did they receive a vision or flash of inspiration to learn their craft?

Consider how your character interacts with the world and what they represent. Consult with your GM regarding guilds or societies your character might belong to.

QUICK BUILD

You can make an inventor quickly by following these suggestions. For the Gadgetsmith, Thundersmith, Cursesmith, or Relicsmith specializations, make your highest ability score Dexterity, followed by Intelligence; for the Golemsmith, Infusionsmith, Potionsmith, or Runesmith specializations, make Intelligence your highest, followed by Constitution or Dexterity; and for Warsmith or Fleshsmith specializations, choose either Strength or Intelligence as your highest, with Constitution as your second-highest ability score. Second, choose a background that emphasizes your connection to a guild or society.

CLASS FEATURES

As an Inventor you gain the following class features.

HIT POINTS

Hit Dice: 1d8 per inventor level 
Hit Points at 1st Level: 8 + your Constitution modifier 
Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per inventor level after 1st

PROFICIENCIES

Armor: Light armor, medium armor 
Weapons: Simple weapons, hand crossbows, heavy crossbows 
Tools: Thieves’ tools, one other tool of your choice 
Saving Throws: Constitution, Intelligence 
Skills: Choose three from Arcana, Deception, History, Investigation, Medicine, Nature, Religion, Sleight of Hand

EQUIPMENT

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

 • (a) a light crossbow and case of 20 bolts or (b) any two simple weapons
 • (a) scale mail, (b) leather armor, or (c) chain mail (if proficient)
 • Thieves’ tools and a dungeoneer’s pack

If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 4d4 × 10 gp to buy your equipment.

INVENTOR SPECIALIZATION

At 1st level, you focus your craft on a particular specialization: Cursesmith, Fleshsmith, Gadgetsmith, Golemsmith, Infusionsmith, Potionsmith, Relicsmith, Thundersmith, or Warsmith, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 3rd, 5th, and 14th level.

MAGIC ITEM ANALYSIS

Starting at 1st level, your understanding of magic items allows you to analyze and understand their secrets. You know the detect magic and identify spells, and you can cast them as a ritual, requiring no material components.

TOOL EXPERTISE

Starting at 2nd level, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses any of the tool proficiencies you gained from this class.

ARCANE RETROFIT

Additionally at 2nd level, you gain the ability to retrofit magical gear. During a long rest you can perform a ritual using any +1, +2, or +3 weapon—excluding artifacts and sentient weapons— to transfer the magic into an inventor weapon (a weapon created by a subclass feature or upgrade). For example, you can turn a +1 longsword and your Impact Gauntlet into a +1 Impact Gauntlet . This includes weapon-like Upgrades that make attack and damage rolls, such as a Warsmith’s Force Blast.

You can’t transfer any properties from a magical weapon besides a bonus to attack and damage rolls, and the original weapon is destroyed in the process.

Additionally, you can convert a set of armor with a magical bonus to AC to a lighter armor type.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Additional Retrofits

At the GM’s option, this feature can be expanded to do similar tasks. For example, you may be allowed to turn a +1 heavy crossbow into a +1 light crossbow, or the GM may choose to allow this feature to work with other magical armor or weapons, such as converting adamantine chain mail into an adamantine chain shirt.

SPELLCASTING

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
At 2nd level, as part of your study of magic you gain the ability to cast spells. The spells you learn are limited in scope, primarily concerned with modifying creatures and objects or creating items.

Spell Slots

The Inventor table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your inventor spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell longstrider and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast longstrider using either slot.

Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know three 1st-level spells of your choice from the inventor spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Inventor table shows when you learn more inventor spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Inventor’s Spellcasting

An inventor is fundamentally someone that understands and regularly interacts with magic, leading to the ability to apply this knowledge as a spellcaster, but how you want to approach your inventor’s spellcasting is up to you.

Feel free to explore other approaches in coordination with your GM. From a functional standpoint, the only requirement is that you have a defined material component or focus for a spell that requires it.
 Consider for some spells perhaps using your artisan’s tools as your focus, or perhaps a specific item you’ve made is your material component for a spell. Perhaps instead of a “component pouch” that simply contains all the material components you could need for your spells, you have an “inventor’s tool belt” that contains the various spellcasting assistance contraptions you’ve made to cast your spells. For mechanical purposes, the only thing that matters is that it functions in the same way and is used consistently.
### Layout: end frame

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the inventor spells you know and replace it with another spell from the inventor spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Spellcasting Focus

You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your inventor spells.

SPECIALIZATION UPGRADE

At 3rd level, choose an upgrade from the list at the end of your specialization, gaining the benefits listed in its description.

You select an additional upgrade at 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, 13th, 15th, 17th, and 19th level. You can’t select an upgrade more than once, unless the upgrade’s description says otherwise. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can exchange one of your existing upgrades with another upgrade of the same level requirement as the replaced upgrade.

Whenever an existing upgrade is exchanged for a replacement upgrade (either by a subclass feature or when you gain a level), the new upgrade is selected as if you’re the level you were when you originally gained that upgrade. For example, if you replace your Stormforged Weapon and reselect all of your upgrades as a 5th-level inventor, you could select one 3rd-level upgrade and one 5th-level upgrade, or two 3rd-level upgrades, but you would not be able to select two 5th-level upgrades.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Customizing Inventor Upgrades

The upgrades for each Inventor Specialization are presented in a list at the end of the subclass, but invariably there will always be ideas for upgrades not included in that list. At the heart of an inventor beats an unrelenting drive for creativity, after all! Feel free to consult your GM for potential custom upgrades.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

### Layout: end frame

The following generic upgrades are available to all subclasses, and can be selected in place of any subclass upgrade:

Shield Proficiency Unrestricted Generic Upgrade 
You gain proficiency with shields.

Tool Proficiency Unrestricted Generic Upgrade 
You gain proficiency with a tool of your choice.

ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

ARCANE RECONSTRUCTION

At 6th level, you have mastered the knowledge of using magic to repair things. You learn the mending cantrip, and you can cast it at will. Additionally, you learn the cure wounds spell. If you already know cure wounds, you learn a different spell of your choice from the inventor spell list. Constructs targeted by your cure wounds can regain hit points as normal.

CROSS-DISCIPLINARY KNOWLEDGE

At 6th level, you can expand on your knowledge across fields. You can craft one of the following: any of the Gadgetsmith’s Unrestricted Upgrades, an Infusionsmith’s Animated Weapon, Blasting Rod, or Infused Weapon, a Potionsmith’s Alchemical Reagent Pouch and Alchemical Fire or Alchemical Acid, or a Thundersmith’s Stormforged Weapon.

If you select a Stormforged Weapon, you gain proficiency with that weapon and knowledge of how to make ammunition for it (if required). You can’t apply Infused Weapon to another weapon granted by this class.

If this crafted item is lost or destroyed, you can remake it following the rules for remaking it in its respective subclass.

WONDROUS ITEM PROFICIENCY

At 7th level, your familiarity with the workings of magical items means that you ignore all class requirements on the use of magic items. Additionally, you can now attune to up to four magic items at once.

IMPROVED MAGICAL CRAFTING

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
At 10th level, your experience in creating your own wondrous inventions makes you more adept at crafting a magic item than normal spellcasters. Creating a non-consumable magic item takes you half the time it would normally take.

Additionally, you can make 1 hour of progress toward crafting a magic item, potion, or scroll during a long rest.

WONDROUS ITEM RECHARGE

Starting at 10th level, you can recharge a magic item that has charges or per rest uses, as long as those charges or uses can only be used to cast spells. To restore charges or uses, you perform a ritual that takes 1 minute and expend a spell slot of a level equal to or greater than the spell slot level of a spell cast by the item.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Interaction with the Crafting System

If you are using the Crafting System presented later in the book, this reduces the time a crafting check takes to 1 hour, allowing you to make two crafting checks during a long rest, or eight during a work day.
### Layout: end frame

The number of charges or uses restored to the item is equal to the number of charges or uses required to cast that spell using the item once.

STUDY OF MAGIC

At 11th level, your proficiency in the workings of magic has become so great you can cast the detect magic and identify spells at will without expending a spell slot.

Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks made to understand the workings of magical traps, effects, or runes.

WONDROUS ITEM MASTERY

Starting at 18th level, you can use a magic item that would normally take an action as a bonus action instead. In addition, you can now attune to up to five magic items at once.

PEERLESS INVENTOR

At 20th level, your mind is always thinking of new options and clever solutions. At the end of a short or long rest, you can create a temporary version of an Upgrade from your subclass that you meet the prerequisites for but don’t already have. This upgrade must have a level requirement of 11th level or lower, and it lasts until you finish a short or long rest, at which time you can select a temporary Upgrade with this feature again.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Magical or Mechanical?

One of the core debates that arises around inventors is if they are a “Magical Engineer” or what a magical engineer would even mean. Do they tinker with mechanics and gears or with magic and runes? The answer is, of course, whatever suits your world, game, and the vision of the player.

 • Class: Inventor

GADGETSMITH

A gadgetsmith is an inventor whose curiosity and inventive genius have run rampant. While other inventors may spend their whole career perfecting a single-minded pursuit, a gadgetsmith believes that quantity is at least as good as quality.

Quick footed and even quicker witted, gadgetsmiths are never caught without another trick up their sleeve—their minds always jumping ahead to solve the next problem with a clever contraption.

A gadgetsmith can come from any walk of life, but they usually exemplify curiosity and a distaste for the suppression of knowledge or technology, usually favoring freedom to experiment and leaning toward more chaotic behaviors.

GADGETSMITH’S PROFICIENCY

When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with nets, rapiers, whips, and tinker’s tools.

ESSENTIAL TOOLS

At 1st level, you’ve mastered the creation of the essential reusable tools for surviving the battlefield as a gadgeteer. You have the following items:

 • Gadgetsmith Weapon. Choose one of the following from the Upgrade section: Impact Gauntlets, Lightning Baton, Repeating Hand Crossbow, Ricocheting Weapon, or Shock Generator. You gain the chosen upgrade, and it doesn’t count against your total number of upgrades.
 • Grappling Hook. You can forgo any attack you make as part of the Attack action to throw your grappling hook at a target within 20 feet of you. The target can be a creature, object, or surface. If the target is Small or smaller, make a grapple check against it, pulling it to you and grappling it on a success. If the target is Medium or larger, you can instead pull yourself to it (no check required); this doesn’t grapple the target. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement are made with disadvantage.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

 • Smoke Bomb. As an action, you can use a smoke bomb to cast the fog cloud spell centered on yourself, without expending a spell slot and requiring no components. The spell lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier and doesn’t require your concentration. When you cast fog cloud in this way, you can choose for it to have a radius of 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet.

### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Unlimited Smoke Bombs?

If you or your GM are concerned about the unlimited use of Smoke Bombs, consider limiting them to a number of uses per short rest equal to your proficiency bonus. This shouldn’t mechanically impact their usage, but the reason they don’t have a limit is to encourage players to feel free to use them in non-combat situations. With limits—even ones that are not usually reached—players tend to treat their Smoke Bomb as an exclusively combat-oriented ability.
### Layout: end frame

ADDITIONAL UPGRADE

At 3rd level, you’ve mastered the essential tools and have begun to tinker with ways to expand your arsenal. The number of upgrades you can have, based on your class level, increases by one. It increases by one again at 5th level (for a total of two more than shown in the Inventor class table).

RECYCLE GADGETS

Starting at 3rd level, you can disassemble your gadgets and create different ones during a long rest. When you finish the rest, you can replace any upgrade you have with a new one.

The chosen upgrade must still be one that is valid for the level at which you gained the replaced upgrade. For example, at 9th level, you can only have one upgrade that has a 9th-level prerequisite.

Additionally, if one of your gadgets is destroyed, you can use this feature to recreate it over the course of a long rest, which requires materials worth 20 gp.

EXTRA ATTACK

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

COMBAT GADGETS

Beginning at 14th level, you can forgo any attack you make as part of the Attack action to use a gadget that normally requires an action to use.

GADGETSMITH UPGRADES

UNRESTRICTED UPGRADES

Airburst Mine 
You create a mechanical device capable of producing a devastating blast. You can use this device to cast shatter or thunderburst mine* without expending a spell slot.

Once used, this gadget can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Belt of Adjusting Size 
You create a belt with a creature size dial on it. While you are wearing the belt, you can use an action to cast the enlarge/ reduce spell on yourself without expending a spell slot.

Once used, this gadget can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Element Eater 
You create a device capable of absorbing incoming elemental damage. You can activate this device as a reaction when you take acid, cold, fire, lightning or thunder damage. The device grants you resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. After triggering it, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 elemental damage of the triggering type.

Once use, this gadget can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Enhanced Grappling Hook 
You enhance the grappling hook gained from the Essential Tools feature, increasing its range to 30 feet. Additionally, when pulling yourself to a Large or larger target, the enhanced power of the grappling hook allows you to drag one Medium or smaller creature with you. The creature must be willing or grappled by you, and it must be within 5 feet of you.

Fire Spitter 
You create a gadget that can create a quick blast of fire. As an action, you can use the gadget to cast burning hands as a 2nd-level spell without expending a spell slot.

Once used, this gadget can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Flashbang 
You create a high-luminosity discharge device. As an action, you can use the device and target a point within 30 feet of you. Any creature within 20 feet of that point must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or be blinded until the end of its next turn.

Once used, this gadget can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Gliding Cloak 
You make a cloak that allows you to glide while falling. When you fall more than 10 feet and aren’t incapacitated, you can spread the cloak to reduce your rate of descent to 30 feet per round, taking no falling damage when you land. While falling in this manner under normal gravity, you can move up to 2 feet horizontally for every 1 foot you descend.

Gravity Switch 
You build a switch that turns off gravity. You can use it to cast fall* without expending a spell slot.

Once used, this gadget can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Impact Gauntlet
 You create a magic weapon capable of amplifying the impact of your blows. You have proficiency with this weapon, and it has the finesse and light properties, as well as the special property (described below). It deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit. You can select this upgrade up to two times, making a separate weapon each time.

Special. When you make an attack with this weapon, you can choose to forgo adding your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. If your attack hits, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the damage roll.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Variant: Power Fist

Your GM may allow you to take the Power Fist upgrade from the Warsmith specialization in place of an Impact Gauntlet, which is similar but deals 1d8 damage and lacks the finesse property. For the purpose of upgrades, Impact Gauntlets and Power Fists should be considered interchangeable.

Jumper Cable (Prerequisite: Shock Generator) 
Once per turn when you deal lightning damage with a cantrip from your Shock Generator, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt.

Additionally, you can use your Shock Generator as an action to make a DC 10 Intelligence (Medicine) check, attempting to stabilize a dying creature within your reach. If you succeed on the check, the creature regains 1 hit point, becoming conscious again, and gains a number of temporary hit points equal to your inventor level. When you stabilize a creature in this way, it gains one level of exhaustion.

Jumping Boots 
You modify your boots with arcane boosters. While wearing these boots, you are under the effects of the jump spell.

Lightning Baton 
You create a magic weapon that channels lightning. You have proficiency with this weapon, and it has the finesse and light properties. It deals 1d4 bludgeoning damage plus 1d4 lightning damage on a hit. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target must succeed a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or become stunned until the start of your next turn. You can choose this upgrade up to two times, making a separate weapon each time.

Mechanical Arm 
You create a mechanical arm, giving you an extra hand. This mechanical arm only functions while it is mounted on gear you are wearing, but can be operated mentally without the need for your hands. This mechanical arm can serve any function a normal hand could, such as holding things, making attacks, and interacting with the environment, but it doesn’t grant you any additional actions.

Mechanical Familiar 
You create the blueprint for a small, mechanical creature. At the end of a long rest, you can choose to create a familiar based on it, casting the find familiar spell without expending a spell slot. When cast in this way, the familiar is a construct. It stays active until you deactivate it or it is destroyed.

In either case, you can choose to reactivate it at the end of a long rest.

Net Launcher 
You build a device capable of delivering nets to their targets more effectively. While you have this upgrade, nets have a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet for you.

Quick Essential Gadget 
You modify your essential gear for quickened use. You can use your Grappling Hook or Smoke Bomb as a bonus action.

Once you use either of them in this way, you can’t use either of them in this way again until you finish a short or long rest.

Repeating Hand Crossbow 
You build an improved hand crossbow. You have proficiency with this weapon, which has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 120 feet, and it has the ammunition and light properties, as well as the special property (described below). It deals 1d6 piercing damage on a hit.

 • Special. This weapon doesn’t require a free hand to load, as it has a built-in loading mechanism. When you make an attack with this weapon as part of the Attack action, and you don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll, you can choose to make the attack roll with disadvantage to make one additional attack with this weapon as a bonus action. The attack roll for this additional attack is also made with disadvantage.

Ricocheting Weapon
 You create a thrown melee weapon enchanted or engineered to ricochet off its targets and return to your hand. You have proficiency with this weapon, which has a normal range of 30 feet and a long range of 90 feet, and it has the finesse and thrown properties, as well as the special property (described below). It deals 1d8 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage on a hit (your choice when you choose this upgrade). You can Arcane Retrofit this weapon.

 • Special. When this weapon is thrown, you can target two creatures within 10 feet of each other, making a separate attack roll against each target; the damage dealt by the attack is halved for each target hit after the first. In addition, the weapon flies back to your hand immediately after the attack.

Shock Generator 
You create a device capable of generating potent shocks. You can use this device to cast shocking grasp . When you cast shocking grasp in this way, you can use either your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier for the attack roll.

Shocking Hook (Prerequisite: Shock Generator) 
You can integrate your Shock Generator and your Grappling Hook. Immediately after using your Grappling Hook to pull a creature to you or to pull yourself to a creature, you can use your bonus action to cast shocking grasp from your Shock Generator targeting that creature.

Sight Lenses 
You create a set of lenses that allow you to see through darkness and obscurement, which you can integrate into a pair of goggles, glasses, or other vision assistance. While using these lenses, you can see through fog, mist, smoke, clouds, and nonmagical darkness out to a range of 15 feet.

Smoke Cloak 
You create a cloak that causes you to blend in with smoke. When you are lightly or heavily obscured by smoke at the start of your turn, you are invisible until your turn ends, or until you cast a spell, make an attack, or deal damage to a creature.

Steelweave Nets 
You thread your nets with metal reinforcement, making them tougher and more conductive. The net has an AC of 15 and resistance to slashing damage. Whenever a creature restrained by the net takes lightning damage, it takes an extra 1d6 lightning damage.
Only you have proficiency with your Steelweave Nets. You can have a number of these nets up to your Intelligence modifier at a time (a minimum of one), and you can replenish your supply of them over the course of a long rest by forging normal nets into Steelweave Nets.

Striding Boots 
You modify your boots with amplified striding speed. While wearing these boots, you are under the effects of the longstrider spell.

Trick Shots 
At the end of a short or long rest, you can add one of the following effects to a piece of ammunition or a thrown weapon, turning it into a trick shot; the effect is expended when you use the trick shot:

 • Arcane Trick. You can imbue a cantrip or 1st-level spell you know into the shot, casting it on impact where the shot lands. The target of the attack is also the spell’s target.
 • Bouncing. You can attack a target within range that has total cover from you if you know the target’s location, bouncing the shot off a surface. The target has the benefit of half cover for the attack, instead of total cover.
 • Ricochet. If you hit a target with the shot, you can make another attack roll against a different target within 10 feet of the first as part of the same attack.
 • Smoke Shot. You can use the shot to deploy a Smoke Bomb on impact where the shot lands.
 • Special Tip. The shot deals one of the following damage types of your choice: bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, acid, cold, fire, or lightning.

You can select this upgrade multiple times, allowing you to make multiple trick shots per rest. You can have a maximum number of trick shots equal to the number of times you have selected this upgrade.

5TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Antimagical Shackle 
You create a set of antimagical shackles. As an action when you are adjacent to a creature, you can attempt to shackle the creature to yourself or a nearby object using these shackles. Make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (target’s choice). A creature that is immune to being grappled or restrained automatically succeeds on this check. If you succeed, the target is shackled to you or the nearby object, and it can only move if it’s able to move what it’s shackled to.

Additionally, while shackled in this way, the target can’t teleport, travel to another plane of existence, alter its form (such as by the polymorph spell), or dematerialize. As an action, the target can make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, breaking the shackles on a success; otherwise, the shackles last until you remove them.

Binding Rope 
You create a rope that is capable of animating and binding a creature. As an action, choose a creature within 30 feet of you. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or become restrained until the end of your next turn. If you are currently grappling the target, it makes the Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage. The rope can only restrain one target at a time.

Crossbow Spider 
You modify a crossbow to be able to aim and fire remotely. As an action, you can deploy a Tiny construct called a crossbow spider (see the construct’s statistics below). Once deployed, you can use a bonus action to cause the construct to move up to its speed and make a crossbow attack from its location. The construct becomes inactive after 1 minute, or after it has been used to make 10 attacks.

Once you have activated the construct, you can’t activate it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to activate it again. If the construct is destroyed, you can’t activate it again until you repair it or recreate it during a long rest.

The construct can’t take any actions besides the ones you direct it to take with your bonus action.

Explosive Gauntlet (Prerequisite: Impact Gauntlet) 
Your gauntlets can exert massive kinetic force when striking. When you make an attack with your Impact Gauntlet, you can choose to be pushed 10 feet in the opposite direction of your attack. Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to attempt to push the target after the attack. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

You can use the movement effect of this gauntlet even if you’re not attacking a target, allowing you to push yourself in any direction (including upwards).

15TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Bee Swarm Rockets 
You design a type of tiny, firecracker-like device, which can release rockets in large numbers. You have a maximum number of rockets equal to your inventor level. As an action, you can release between 1 and 10 rockets. Each rocket targets a point you can see within 40 feet of you. Each creature within 10 feet of one of these points must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC.

Creatures in the area of effect of multiple rockets make a separate saving throw for each rocket. For each failed save, a creature takes 2d6 + 1 fire damage, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can replenish your supply of rockets to your maximum over the course of a long rest.

Bracers of Empowerment

GOLEMSMITH

Golemsmiths are inventors who have committed themselves to creating a true work of artifice, forging a golem. With this painstaking life ambition, they plan and design meticulously, even if, in practice, sometimes compromises on materials must be made.

Why a golemsmith embarks on the quest to forge this artificial construct of life can vary. For many it is the pure pursuit of forging the perfect creation; while for others, it is simply so they do not have to carry around their loot, or to have a loyal companion to count on at all times.

A golemsmith is rarely chaotic, as they are people of great care and discipline—those that are not would not have succeeded where they have. However, some have been set on their path by such events that might drive them to interact chaotically with society as a whole.

GOLEMSMITH'S PROFICIENCY

When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with smith’s tools and tinker’s tools.

MECHANICAL GOLEM

Starting at 1st level, you forge a mechanical golem to carry out your orders and protect you. The golem is under your control and understands the languages you speak, but it can’t speak.

The golem obeys your commands as best it can. On your turn, you can verbally command it where to move (no action required by you), and you can use your action to command it to take an action. Additionally, whenever it would be able to take a reaction, you must use your reaction to command it to take that reaction. The golem acts on your commands during your turn. If you issue no commands to your golem, it takes no actions.

The base statistics of your golem are as follows:
### Layout: end frame

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Your golem’s proficiency bonus increases when yours does. If the golem is killed, it can be returned to life by normal means, such as the revivify spell, or you can repair it during a long rest if you have access to its body. At the end of the long rest, it returns to life with half its hit points (rounded down).

If the golem is beyond recovery, you can recreate it exactly as it was, with four days of work (8 hours each day) and 100 gp of raw materials.

Over the course of a short rest, you can restore hit points to your golem equal to your Intelligence modifier + your inventor level, or you can fully repair it to during a long rest, causing it to regain all its hit points. Any spells you cast that cause the target to regain hit points ignore any restrictions against constructs for your golem.

GOLEM CHASSIS

When you create your golem, you can choose one of the chassis below, adding the prefix to its type. For example, if you select Ironwrought, your golem becomes an Ironwrought Golem and gains the corresponding modifications to its base statistics.

Launcher

Your golem becomes akin to a mobile turret, taking the frame of a ballista or other launching device. Its Dexterity becomes 16 (+3), its speed becomes 25 feet, and it has the following natural weapon attack, which uses its Dexterity for the attack and damage rolls:

 • Shoot. Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 1d10 + 3 piercing damage.

Quadrupedal

Your golem takes on a quadrupedal design. Larger and sturdier, it is more suitable to launch into the fray or carry its creator. Its size becomes Large, its base AC becomes 16, and its speed becomes 35 feet. In addition, its Strength and Constitution become 16 (+3), and it has the following natural weapon attack, which uses its Strength for the attack and damage rolls:

 • Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d10 + 3 piercing damage.

 • NPC: Quadrupedal Golem

Specialized

Your golem defies all expectations, its design fueled by your own rampant creativity. A little less robust and stable, it is far more extensible to your visionary plans. Your golem starts with the basic golem statistics, but you can select two free upgrades for it that don’t count against your upgrade total. In addition, it has the following natural weapon attack, which uses its Strength for the attack and damage rolls:

 • Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d8 + 2 bludgeoning damage.

 • NPC: Specialized Golem

OPTIONAL GOLEM CHASSIS: FLESH GOLEM

When a golemsmith is selecting their golem, some disturbed minds think “but what if I want it be a fleshy monstrosity against sanity?” Well, as usual, the inventor is here for you:

Flesh

Your golem is roughly humanoid, a lumbering terror of stitched flesh with an odd smell. Its Strength becomes 16 (+3), it gains proficiency with shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons, and it has the following natural weapon attack, which uses its Strength for the attack and damage rolls:

 • Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d4 + 3 bludgeoning damage.

Additional Changes

 • Replace your smith’s tools proficiency with leatherworker’s tools proficiency.
 • The upgrades are the same, but with “...but from some gross, fleshy organ.”
 • At your GM’s discretion, you can apply Fleshsmith upgrades to your golem. This has the potential to cause balance issues, so assume the GM will say no unless it’s not too powerful and you can explain how it’s not.

 • NPC: Flesh Golem

Ironwrought

Your golem is roughly humanoid and comes with the robust flexibility and options that this form provides. Its Strength becomes 16 (+3), it gains proficiency with shields, simple weapons, and martial weapons, and it has the following natural weapon attack, which uses its Strength for the attack and damage rolls:

 • Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1d4 + 3 bludgeoning damage.

 • NPC: Ironwrought Golem

Winged

Your golem is modeled off a flying creature. Smaller and more lightweight than most golems, it is kept aloft by intricate wings. Its size becomes Small, it gains a flying speed of 30 feet, and it has the following natural weapon attack, which uses its Strength for the attack and damage rolls:

 • Talon. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5ft., one target. Hit: 1d8 + 2 slashing damage.

 • NPC: Winged Golem

INTELLIGENT OVERSIGHT

Starting at 3rd level, you can take the Help action as a bonus action when assisting your golem.

Additionally, when you take the Help action to aid an ally (including your golem) in attacking a creature, the target of that attack can be up to 30 feet away from you, rather than within 5 feet of you, if your ally can see or hear you.

AUTONOMOUS ACTION

Starting at 5th level, you no longer need to spend your action or reaction to command your golem to use its action or reaction, and you can issue commands to it mentally while it is within 60 feet of you.

If the golem isn’t commanded to take any action, it will take the Dodge action in combat.

MAGICAL NATURE

Additionally at 5th level, your golem’s natural weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

PERFECTED DESIGN

Starting at 14th level, your golem can add your Intelligence modifier to all of its attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.

GOLEMSMITH UPGRADES

UNRESTRICTED UPGRADES

Arcane Barrage Armament 
You install a mounted armament on your golem, taking whatever form is most appropriate, which is charged with arcane power. As an action, the golem can cast magic missile through the armament, without expending a spell slot and requiring no components.
Once the golem casts the spell in this way, it can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach 5th level in this class, the spell is cast as a 2nd-level spell, and it increases again when you reach 11th level (as a 3rd-level spell) and 17th level (as a 4th-level spell).

Arcane Resonance 
You craft a magical essence connector and install it into your golem’s core, allowing you and the golem to share certain magical effects. You can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your golem.

Defender Protocol 
You build a protocol into your golem, instructing it to defend its master. The golem gains the Protection Fighting Style.

Ether Heart 
You install a magical ether heart into your golem, because that seems like a good idea. Your golem gains 2 charges. It can expend 1 charge to cast any 1st-level spell you know, and it regains all expended charges when you finish a long rest.

Flamethrower Armament 
You install an armament to your golem, taking whatever form is most appropriate, which is capable of producing powerful flames. As an action, the golem can cast burning hands through the armament, without expending a spell slot and requiring no components. The spell save DC is equal to your spell save DC.

Once the golem casts the spell in this way, it can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

When you reach 5th level in this class, the spell is cast as a 2nd-level spell, and it increases again when you reach 11th level (as a 3rd-level spell) and 17th level (as a 4th-level spell).

Fine-Tuned Dexterity 
You craft improved gears and joints for your golem. Your golem’s Dexterity score increases by 2, increasing its ability to perform tasks that require fine motor skills. If this upgrade increases the golem’s Dexterity to 16 or higher, it gains proficiency with thieves’ tools; if this upgrade increases its Dexterity to 18, it gains proficiency in the Stealth skill.

You can select this upgrade multiple times, but you can’t increase the golem’s Dexterity above 18 using this upgrade.

Grappling Appendages 
You install an additional pair of grappling appendages to your golem, which take a form of your choice. For the purpose of grappling, these appendages count as two additional free hands for your golem. Additionally, as long as your golem isn’t using these appendages to grapple, it has a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.

Heavy Armor Plating 
You can incorporate a suit of heavy armor into your golem, allowing it to calculate its armor class as if it was wearing that armor. Your golem is proficient with the incorporated armor, and it has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks until the armor is removed. You can remove the incorporated armor or incorporate a new suit of armor at any time, but it takes twice as long as it would normally take to don or doff the armor.

Magical Essence 
You infuse a fragment of magical essence into your golem, allowing it to attune to one magic item. This follows all normal attunement rules.

Structural Constitution 
You have reinforced your golem with layers of protection and redundant systems. Your golem’s Constitution score increases by 2, increasing its stability and durability. If this upgrade increases the golem’s Constitution to 16 or higher, it gains proficiency in Constitution saving throws; if this upgrade increases its Constitution to 18, it has advantage on death saving throws.

You can select this upgrade multiple times, but you can’t increase the golem’s Constitution above 18 using this upgrade.

Systematic Strength 
You build an improved frame and power source for your golem. Your golem’s Strength score increases by 2, increasing its ability to perform tasks that require raw strength. If this upgrade increases the golem’s Strength to 16 or higher, it gains proficiency in Strength saving throws; if this upgrade increases its Strength to 18, it gains proficiency in the Athletics skill.

You can select this upgrade multiple times, but you can’t increase the golem’s Strength above 18 using this upgrade.

Warfare Routines 
You advance the control routines for your golem, allowing it to fight more effectively. Your golem gains one of the following Fighting Styles of your choice: Archery, Dueling, or Great Weapon Fighting.

5TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Cloaking Device 
You install an arcane cloaking device on your golem. Your golem can use this device to cast invisibility on itself, without expending a spell slot or requiring components.

Once the golem casts the spell in this way, it can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Expanded Frame 
You enlarge your golem, increasing its size by one category, up to a maximum of Large. If your golem is Large after taking this upgrade, it gains advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and its hit point maximum increases to (5 + (the golem's Constitution modifier +5) * your inventor level).

During the process, you can determine if your golem will have the appropriate anatomy to serve as a mount. You can select this upgrade multiple times, but you can’t increase the golem’s size above Large using this upgrade.

Iron Fortress Prerequisite: golem of Medium or larger size with a Constitution of 18 or higher 
You extend your golem’s shielding and stationary stability. Your golem now counts as three-quarters cover for creatures riding it or for creatures within 5 feet of it (as long as it is between the target and the attacker). Additionally, while your golem is on the ground, it can’t be moved against its will.

Reciprocity Programming 
If you use your bonus action to take the Help action to grant your golem advantage on an attack against a creature, your golem can take the Help action as a bonus action on its next turn to grant you advantage on an attack against a creature.

Shielding Bond 
After studying the arcane fundamentals of Shield Golems, you have gained insight on how they shield their controllers, and can implement it in your own golem. Your golem gains the ability to cast warding bond without expending a spell slot. When cast in this method, it doesn’t require material components.

Once the golem casts warding bond in this way, it can’t use this feature to cast it again until it finishes a short or long rest.

9TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Mark of Sapience (Incompatible: Launcher Golem Chassis) 
You have attained the understanding of magic to craft a Mark of Sapience on the forehead of your Mechanical Golem, turning it into a Golem Companion. Its mental ability scores increase, granting it an Intelligence of 10, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 8. This allows it speak, remember things, and follow more complex commands without direct input. Additionallly, it gains proficiency in Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Roleplaying an Ironwrought Companion

If you choose the Mark of Sapience upgrade, your Ironwrought Golem becomes a sapient companion, capable of learning, thinking, and having opinions. Consider how this may impact your interactions.

Fundamentally, a Ironwrought Companion is still entirely loyal to its creator, but it can develop a personality and thoughts of its own.

Overdrive 
You build in a special mode that allows your golem to push beyond its limitations. As an action, you can overcharge your golem with energy, granting it the effects of the haste spell for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier.

Once you overcharge your golem in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Powered Charge 
You improve your golem’s charging capabilities, increasing its walking speed by 5 feet. If your golem has a walking speed of 40 feet or higher after taking this upgrade, it gains the Forceful Slam trait below. You can select this upgrade up to two times.

 • Forceful Slam. If the golem moves at least 20 feet straight toward a target and then immediately hits it with a melee attack, the target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + the golem’s proficiency bonus + its Strength modifier) or be knocked prone.

11TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Airborne Propulsion 
You add a new method of propulsion to your golem, such as intricate mechanical wings or propellers. It gains a flying speed of 30 feet.

Multiattack Protocol 
Your golem can attack twice, instead of once, whenever it takes the Attack action on its turn.

Thundering Stomp (Prerequisite: Golem of Large size) 
Your golem can leverage its increased size and magical nature, allowing it to replace any attack it makes as part of the Attack action with a crushing stomp of magical energy as it brings down its foot. When it does so, each creature within 5 feet of the golem, other than itself, must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d6 thunder damage.

Transforming Golem 
You install clever, multifunctional components into your golem, allowing it to reduce its size. Your golem can collapse itself down, decreasing its size by one category—from Medium to Small, for example. While collapsed in this way, its speed is reduced by 10 feet. It takes 1 minute for your golem to collapse itself or revert to its normal size.

15TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Artificial Learning (Prerequisite: Mark of Sapience) 
Your Golem Companion begins to apply its abilities to learn new things, gaining one level in a class of your choice. Your Golem Companion gains all the 1st-level features of the chosen class. This doesn’t include hit points, Hit Dice, or class proficiencies. For example, choosing the Fighter class grants the golem the Fighting Style and Second Wind features, but nothing else.

You can select this upgrade multiple times, granting your golem another level of features from the same class or the 1st-level features from another class each time it is selected.

Brutal Armaments 
You increase the effectiveness of your golem’s natural weapons, allowing it to attack with lethal strikes. When your golem makes an attack, you can choose to subtract its proficiency from the attack roll. If you do so, and the attack hits, you can add double its proficiency bonus to the damage roll of the attack.

Shared Power 
You bind your golem’s power source to your own soul, allowing you to tap its power and it to tap your power. Your golem can use its action and expend one of your spell slots to cast a spell you know of the slot’s level or lower.

In addition, you can use your action to cause your golem to lose a number of hit points up to twice your inventor level, granting you a number of temporary hit points equal to that amount.

Finally, on your turn, you can forgo your action to grant your golem an additional action, or you can command your golem to forgo its action, granting yourself an additional action. That action can only be used to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.

Titan Slayer 
You build into your golem one oversized weapon. This weapon can be a martial melee weapon or an improved version of any natural weapon the golem has. The weapon’s base damage dice are doubled—from 1d8 to 2d8, for example. The golem can only attack with this oversized weapon once per turn (making any additional attacks it can make using other weapons).

 • Inventor Specialization : Golemsmith
 • Feature: Golemsmith Upgrades

INFUSIONSMITH

An infusionsmith is, in some ways, perhaps the most quintessential type of inventor. While other inventors may delve into mechanics and tinkering, an infusionsmith tinkers with magic itself.

These inventors are on the cutting edge of magical engineering, understanding the principal applications of magic. Infusionsmiths would have ground to stand on in calling a wizard an impulsive spellslinger, for they are the inventors that work their magic through careful and meticulous study, laying down magic they may not use for hours, or painstakingly crafting a long-lasting enchantment.

An infusionsmith can be a magical swordsman, a wandslinger, or a bookish supporting character with a bagful of tricks that never quite runs dry. Some will stand within a maelstrom of animated blades, while others will plink away with a crossbow that seems unerringly accurate, but their common theme is using their prowess of infusion to make themselves formidable.

INFUSIONSMITH'S PROFICIENCY

When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with calligrapher’s supplies and jeweler’s tools. Your knowledge of infusion magic also gives you a natural affinity for scribing spell scrolls. The time you must spend to create a magic spell scroll is halved.

INFUSED ARMAMENT

Starting at 1st level, you can infuse a powerful armament to take into battle. At the end of a long rest, select one of the infusions below. The infusion lasts until the end of your next long rest.

Animated Weapon

You touch a melee weapon, causing it to spring to life. This Animated Weapon can be carried or stowed like a normal weapon, or you can ready it, causing it to float beside you. While an Animated Weapon is readied, you can make attacks with it as part the Attack action, sending it out to strike a target. All attacks made with your Animated Weapon during a turn must be made against the same target.

This special attack is a melee spell attack with which you are proficient. You can make this special attack against a target out to a range of 30 feet away from you. If the weapon has the heavy or special property, this range is halved to 15 feet; and if the weapon has the light property, this range is doubled to 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes damage equal to the weapon’s damage dice + your Intelligence modifier.

Blasting Rod

You touch a nonmagical object—a wand-blank, stick, staff, or rod—turning it into a Blasting Rod and infusing it with the ability to cast a cantrip. Select one evocation cantrip from the wizard spell list that doesn’t require concentration. Thereafter, as an action, you can use the Blasting Rod to cast that cantrip.

Once per turn, when you deal damage to a creature or object with your Blasting Rod, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt to that target.

Infused Weapon

You touch a weapon, enchanting it. While this weapon is enchanted, you (and only you) have proficiency with it. This Infused Weapon can be wielded like a normal weapon, but it gains the following special property:

You can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Strength or Dexterity, for the weapon’s attack and damage rolls. In addition, if the weapon has a single damage die, the size of that die increases by one (to a maximum of a d12). For example, if the Infused Weapon is a dagger, its damage die increases from a d4 to a d6.

SPELL MANUAL

At 3rd level, you have a Spell Manual containing two 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your Spell Manual is a repository of any non-inventor spell you know.

You can’t cast spells from your Spell Manual, and they don’t count against your number of spells known, but whenever you would learn a new inventor spell, you can select a spell from your Spell Manual instead of the inventor spell list. That spell then becomes an inventor spell for you, and you can cast it as normal. You can choose to scribe any inventor spell you know into your Spell Manual, as if copying it from a written spell.

Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher. Each time you gain an inventor level, you can add one wizard spell of your choice to your Spell Manual for free. The chosen spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Inventor table.

On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your Spell Manual. For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp.

INFUSE MAGIC

Also at 3rd level, you can use your Spell Manual to infuse magic items, such as wands, storing magical power for later use. Over the course of 1 minute, you can perform a special ritual to cast a spell into the item, expending a spell slot as normal. The spell being stored has no immediate effect when cast in this way.

Thereafter, a creature holding the item that is aware there is magic infused in it can trigger the stored magic, casting the spell. The creature must have an Intelligence of 6 or higher to cast the spell in this way.

The spell uses your spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability, but is in all other ways treated as if the creature holding it cast the spell. The spell infused in the item fades if you finish a long rest and the stored magic hasn’t been triggered.

EXTRA ATTACK

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

EMPOWERED INFUSIONS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
By the time you reach 5th level, your Infused Armament grows more powerful. If you infuse or animate a weapon, you can infuse or animate one additional weapon at the same time (having two Animated Weapons, two Infused Weapons, or one of each). If you have multiple Animated Weapons, you can attack the same or different targets with them during a turn.

If you cast a spell of 1st level or higher using an item from Infuse Magic or an upgrade, or from a magic wand, you can cast the cantrip from your Blasting Rod as a bonus action.

INFUSED FOCUS

Starting at 14th level, you can anchor a powerful spell into an item. When you cast a spell that requires concentration, you can anchor it to an object you touch (such as a staff, wand, or weapon), causing the spell to not require your concentration. When you do so, the spell lasts a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier, after which the spell ends.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Benefits of Flexibility?

If you choose to have an Animated and Infused Weapon, you can attack twice with either, but will limit yourself to being able to only attack one target if you solely rely on the Animated Weapon. If you animate two weapons, you can split your attacks like normal using one to attack a different creature. Alternatively, you can animate a short-range heavy weapon and a long-range light weapon, giving you more options at different ranges but limiting your ability to target multiple targets at any optimal range.
### Layout: end frame

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

INFUSIONSMITH UPGRADES

UNRESTRICTED UPGRADES

Animated Archer 
You master animation enchantments, allowing you to use your Animate Weapon feature on a ranged weapon and a quiver of ammunition. An animated ranged weapon hovers near you, and you can make a ranged spell attack with it against a target within the weapon’s range.

On a hit, the target takes damage equal to the weapon’s damage dice + your Intelligence modifier. The weapon requires ammunition, and it can carry up 30 pieces of ammunition at a time. You can reload the ammunition at any time as an action.

Arcane Armament 
You master armoring yourself with magical enchantments. You learn the mage armor spell. While under the effect of mage armor , you can add your Intelligence modifier to your AC, instead of your Dexterity modifier. You can only do this if you are not adding your Intelligence modifier to your AC from another source.

Additionally, you gain resistance to force damage.

Loyal Weapon 
You can cast the returning weapon* spell without expending a spell slot, but if you cast it on a second weapon with this upgrade, the spell immediately fades from any previous use of this upgrade.

Magical Wand of... 
You create a new wand that you can infuse with a spell of 1st level or higher that you have recorded in your Spell Manual. This wand doesn’t require attunement, but can only be used by you. The spell must be of a level that you can cast as an inventor (as of when you would choose this upgrade). This wand has 3 charges.

You can expend a charge to cast the chosen spell at its lowest level. The wand regains all expended charges when you finish a long rest.

You can select this upgrade multiple times, choosing a different spell and creating a new wand each time you select this upgrade.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Magic Wand Spell Level

A Magical Wand created using an upgrade slot at level 3 can always only ever cast 1st-level spells. For example, at level 5 if you have two Magical Wand upgrades, you will have one that can cast 1st-level spells, and one that can cast 2nd-level spells. Even if you later swap the upgrade, the Wand is still an Upgrade from level 3, and selected as if you are level 3 and only able to cast 1st-level spells.

### Layout: end frame

Skilled Infusions 
You manage to make the magic of your Animated and Infused Weapons so potent that attacks made with them gain the benefits of a fighting style. Attacks made with one-handed melee weapons gain Dueling, attacks made with two-handed melee weapons gain Great Weapon Fighting, and attacks made with ranged weapons gain Archery.

Soul-Saving Bond 
You set up a special magical bond between you and another creature. When either of the bonded creatures fails an Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, or death saving throw, the other creature can make the same saving throw, replacing the original result with its own. If this ability is used on a death saving throw, the roll is automatically a 20.

Once this ability has been used to replace a roll, it can’t be used again until both bonded creatures have finished a short or long rest.

This bond can be set up with a different creature at the end of a long rest.

Warding Stone 
You learn how to weave a protective enchantment on an item. That item gains a pool of temporary hit points equal to your Inventor level. Any creature carrying the item gains any temporary hit points remaining in its pool, but these hit points are lost if that creature is no longer carrying the item.

The item’s pool of temporary hit points replenishes when you finish a long rest.

Worn Enchantment 
You can enchant an item you are wearing, such as a cloak or scarf, to animate and assist you with a task, be it climbing a wall, grappling an enemy, or picking a lock. You can expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher as an action to gain proficiency in one Strength- or Dexterity-based skill of your choice until you finish a long rest.

Additionally, you can choose to use up all the magic in the item to gain advantage on one ability check using the chosen skill. After you do so, you lose the proficiency granted by this upgrade.

5TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Animated Shield 
You apply your animation magic to a shield. At the end of a long rest, you can touch a shield, causing it to spring to life and protect you until you finish your next long rest. While it is protecting you, you gain the benefits of the shield as if you were wielding it. As usual, you can benefit from only one shield at a time.

While you have an animated shield, you can also send it to defend your allies. When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. When you do so, you lose the benefits of the animated shield until the start of your next turn.

Arcane Ammunition 
You infuse a ranged weapon with special, arcane magic. The weapon no longer requires ammunition to fire, as it creates magical ammunition when you fire it, and whenever you hit a target with this magical ammunition, the attack deals force damage, instead of the weapon’s normal damage type.

Additionally, if the weapon had the loading property, it no longer has that property.

Deflecting Weapon 
While you have an animated melee weapon, you can use your reaction when a creature makes a weapon attack against you to attempt to block it, rolling a d8 and adding the number rolled to your AC for that attack. You make this choice after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM says whether the attack hits or misses. If you attempt to block a melee weapon attack in this way and the attack misses, you can immediately make one weapon attack against the attacker as part of the same reaction.
When you use this ability, if you take the Attack action on your next turn, you can only make one weapon attack as part of that action. This attack can’t be made with the animated weapon you used to attempt to block the attack.

Lesser Ring of Protection 
You make a prototype ring of protection . Any creature wearing this ring gains a +1 bonus to its AC.

Malicious Infusion 
You learn the heat metal spell.

Additionally, as a reaction to being hit by a metal weapon, you can cast heat metal targeting the weapon that struck you, expending a spell slot as normal.

Ring of Reaction 
You make a minor magic ring. Any creature wearing this ring can add your Intelligence modifier to its Dexterity saving throws and initiative rolls.

Translocation Binding 
When you make an attack with an Animated or Infused melee weapon, you can use your bonus action and expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the weapon before it returns to you. You can use this ability even if your attack misses the target.

Weapon Enchantment Expertise 
When you cast arcane weapon* , magic weapon , or vorpal weapon* , the targeted weapon deals an extra 1d4 force damage, and when you cast prismatic weapon* , the extra damage it deals increases by 1d4.

Additionally, you have advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on arcane weapon*, prismatic weapon* , magic weapon , and vorpal weapon* .

Weapon Enchantment Resonance 
When you cast arcane weapon* , prismatic weapon* , magic weapon , or vorpal weapon* on one of your Animated or Infused weapons, all of your Animated and Infused weapons gain the benefits of that spell. Additionally, you can target any weapon with arcane weapon*, prismatic weapon* , or magic weapon , even if the weapon is already magical.

9TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Detonate Armament (Prerequisite: Arcane Armament) 
When you take damage while under the effects of mage armor , you can end the effects of that spell as a reaction to cast turbulent warp* without expending a spell slot.

Once you cast the spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Dimensional Pockets 
You enchant a pocket on your gear to contain far more than it would appear. That pocket can hold up to 50 pounds, and you can put any object in it that can fit through a 6-inch-diameter opening. The pocket otherwise behaves like a bag of holding.

Invisibility Cloak 
You make an invisibility cloak. While wearing this cloak, a creature can cast invisibility on itself, without expending a spell slot or material components. When cast in this way, the spell doesn’t require the caster’s concentration. The spell ends if the caster is no longer wearing the cloak or if they choose to end the spell early (no action required).

Once a creature uses the cloak to cast this spell, it can’t be used in this way again until you finish a short or long rest.

Prepared Enchantment 
You can cast a limited version of contingency , without expending a spell slot or material components, as you bestow magical enchantments onto your gear. When you cast the spell in this way, it ends if you finish a long rest before the contingent spell is triggered, and the contingent spell must be a spell of 2nd level or lower.

Once you cast contingency in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Spell-Trapping Ring 
At the end of a long rest, you can set a powerful magic into a nonmagical ring you touch. You can use this ring to cast counterspell without expending a spell slot. When you cast counterspell in this way and it succeeds, the spell you countered is stored in the ring. You can cast the stored spell from the ring without expending a spell slot, but that spell fades if you don’t cast it before you finish a long rest.

Once you cast counterspell to store a spell in this ring, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

11TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Empower Weapon 
When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can use your bonus action to infuse your strike with arcane energy, dealing an extra 2d6 force damage to the target. When you use this bonus action, you can also choose to expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to further increase this extra damage. When you do so, the target takes an extra 1d6 force damage, plus another 1d6 per level of the spell slot.

Enchanted Broom 
You can enchant a broom (or broom-like object), turning it into a broom of flying . You set the command word for the broom, and it only obeys you.

Life Infusion 
You learn a potent magical infusion that suffuses a creature with life energy. You can cast regenerate , without expending a spell slot or material components.

Once you cast the spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Magical Rod of... 
You create a new rod that you can infuse with a spell of 5th level or higher that you have recorded in your Spell Manual. This rod doesn’t require attunement, but can only be used by you. The spell must be of a level no higher than half your inventor level (as of when you would choose this upgrade), rounded down.

You can use the rod to cast the chosen spell at its lowest level. Once you cast the spell in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can select this upgrade multiple times, choosing a different spell and creating a new rod each time you select this upgrade.

How to get high-level spells?

Astute players will note that when you add spells to your Spell Manual through leveling, the spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, but when you gain access to the Magical Rod upgrade, you don’t yet have 5th-level spell slots. Spells for Magical Rods will primarily have to be found in the wild, in the form of scrolls or spellbooks, and copied into your Spell Manual that way.
### Layout: end frame

Mixed Technique 
When you use your action to cast the cantrip from your Blasting Rod, you can make one weapon attack with an Animated or Infused Weapon as a bonus action.

15TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Advanced Object Animation 
When you cast the animate objects spell, the animated objects use your spell attack bonus for their attack rolls, and they gain a bonus to their damage rolls based on their size: +1 (Tiny or Small), +2 (Medium), +4 (Large), or +8 (Huge).

Third Animated Weapon 
Your mastery of weapon animation expands to a greater breadth of control. If you have two Animated Weapons, you can animate a third weapon with your Animate Weapon feature. When you take the Attack action and make an attack with your other two Animated Weapons, you can make an attack with your third Animated Weapon as part of the same action.

 • Inventor Specialization: Infusionsmith
 • Feature: Infusionsmith Upgrades

POTIONSMITH

A potionsmith is an inventor who has pursued the secrets of alchemy. While many a village has an apothecary grinding odd herbs and roots into potent (or not so potent) concoctions, the careful process of mixing and brewing is just one way to achieve results. Through the use of the intricate secrets of the craft and direct infusions using magical rituals, a potionsmith can come up with explosive results in the blink of an eye... sometimes literally.

A potionsmith can be a scholar who has delved into the knowledge the world has to offer or an explorer that has unlocked the secrets of the wilderness. Their knowledge could come from being friends of the fey or from unfettered access to the royal library. As such, potionsmith’s can be good or evil, lawful or chaotic.

POTIONSMITH'S PROFICIENCY

When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with blowguns, alchemist’s supplies, and the herbalism kit.

Your knowledge of alchemy gives you a natural affinity for brewing potions. Creating a potion through normal crafting takes you only half the time it would normally take.

ALCHEMICAL REAGENTS POUCH

At 1st level, you’ve acquired a pouch of useful basic reagents, much as a wizard might carry a component pouch. You’ve tucked away things that will come in handy, and can retrieve them as part of using an ability that might require them. As long as you have this pouch on you, you can use the potionsmith’s features. This pouch is considered to be alchemist’s supplies for the purposes of crafting.

If you lose your reagent pouch, you can spend 50 gp to reacquire the various stocks you need, or spend 1 full day gathering them from a natural environment without expense.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Alchemists and Potions

Immediately on making a potionsmith, one may think of the magic potions that exist in most settings—from the simple potion of healing to the legendary potion of storm giant strength. However, someone does not need to be a potionsmith to make these, as crafting rules for them are open to all classes.

A potionsmith with their proficiency will certainly have the edge in potion crafting, but these potions are not fundamental to the class.

### Layout: end frame

INSTANT REACTIONS

At 1st level, you know how to get instant reactions to occur without the niceties of grinding, simmering, and brewing required for more refined concoctions.

Moreover, you know enough ways to do these processes that with just a few standard supplies, you can get results out of a wide range of things you can gather in almost any locale and a pinch from your reagent pouch.

Pick three instant reactions from the following: Alchemical Acid, Alchemical Fire, Fortifying Fumes, Healing Draught, and Poisonous Gas. These instant reactions don’t count against your number of upgrades known.

ALCHEMICAL INFUSIONS

At 3rd level, you have discovered the secrets to drastically bypass the alchemical brewing process, crafting potent magical effects through the direct infusion of the potion with your own magic. When you finish a short or long rest, you can create any number of potions, choosing one of the following spells for each potion and expending a spell slot as if you were casting the spell. You must provide an empty vial for each potion you create in this way.

XXXXXXXXX
Spell Level	Infusion Spells
1st	cure wounds, fog cloud, grease, heroism
2nd	barkskin, lesser restoration, shatter, web
3rd	blink, haste, stinking cloud, water breathing
4th	confusion, stoneskin
5th	cloudkill

When you do so, the spell doesn’t take effect immediately, but is instead infused into the potion.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
If the spell grants an effect or restores hit points, a creature can consume it or administer it to another creature as an action. If a spell targets an area of effect, you can accurately throw the vial up to 30 feet, dealing no inherent damage, but breaking the vial on impact. The area of effect takes place when the vial is broken, with the effect centered on where the vial breaks. If the spell targets a creature, you can treat the vial as a ranged weapon with which you are proficient, and it has the thrown (20/60) property. You replace the spell attack with making a weapon attack made with the vial.

If the spell has a non-instantaneous effect that normally requires concentration, it doesn’t require your concentration when it takes effect in this way, but its duration is shortened to a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). A spell that doesn’t require concentration lasts its normal duration. An infused potion loses its potency if it isn’t used by the end of your next long rest.

You can gain additional spells for your Alchemical Infusions through your potionsmith upgrades.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
On Creativity and Catapults

While you can only accurately throw the vial containing an infused potion up to 30 feet, as per the feature, the trigger merely specifies that the effect takes place where it breaks.

If you can find another way to deliver the vial, such as the launch object* spell (or a similar spell) on the inventor spell list—or, well, an actual catapult—you can apply these methods as well.
### Layout: end frame

PRACTICED QUAFF

Additionally at 3rd level, you gain the ability to consume potions and infused potions as a bonus action.

EMPOWERED ALCHEMY

Starting at 5th level, whenever you deal damage, grant temporary hit points, or restore hit points to a creature with an instant reaction or infused potion on your turn, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the amount of damage dealt or the number of hit points granted or restored.

INFUSION EXPERTISE

Starting at 14th level, when you create an infused potion at end of a short or long rest, the first infused potion you create doesn’t require a spell slot to infuse, and you can choose a spell for which you would not otherwise have a high enough level spell slot when making this infusion.

POTIONSMITH UPGRADES

UNRESTRICTED UPGRADES

Alchemical Acid (Instant Reaction) 
As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, throwing this combination of reagents at a point within 20 feet of you, which causes a caustic acid to splatter the area within a 5-footradius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 2d4 acid damage. Damage from this acid deals double damage to objects and structures.

The damage increases by 2d4 when you reach 5th level (4d4), 11th level (6d4), and 17th level (8d4).

Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to prepare this instant reaction as a ranged weapon with which you are proficient. It lasts until the end of your turn, and it has the finesse and thrown (20/60) properties. On a hit, it deals damage equal to failing the saving throw against this effect. The damage dealt by this attack doesn’t include your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

Alchemical Fire (Instant Reaction) 
As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, tossing a quick combination of reagents at a point within 20 feet of you, which causes searing fire to flare up in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d8 fire damage.

This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to prepare this instant reaction as a ranged weapon with which you are proficient. It lasts until the end of your turn, and it has the finesse and thrown (20/60) properties. On a hit, it deals damage equal to failing the saving throw against this effect. The damage dealt by this attack doesn’t include your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

Delivery Mechanism 
You modify the stability of your reagents and develop a better delivery mechanism. You can target a point within 40 feet of you for your instant reactions (including ones gained from upgrades, such as Explosive Reaction) and infused potions that target a point. This additional precision enables you to better target the effects, allowing each creature of your choice in the area to automatically succeed on its Dexterity saving throw against the effects of your instant reactions and infused potions.

Additionally, when making an attack roll with an instant reaction or infused potion, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Dexterity modifier, for the attack roll.

Dragon Draught (Instant Reaction; upgrade only) 
As an action, you can quaff a vial of highly reactive liquid, allowing you to immediately belch a blast of devastating elemental energy. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, cold, fire, or lightning.

If you choose cold or fire damage, the area of effect is a 10-foot cone; if you choose acid or lightning damage, the area of effect is a 15-foot line. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d8 damage of the chosen type.

The damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Explosive Reaction (Instant Reaction; upgrade only) 
As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, throwing a devastating combination of reagents at a point within 20 feet of you, which causes a minor explosion. Each creature within 10 feet of that point must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d10 thunder damage from the shockwave of the explosion.

The damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).

Alternatively, you can use a bonus action to prepare this instant reaction as a ranged weapon with which you are proficient. It lasts until the end of your turn, and it has the finesse and thrown (20/60) properties. On a hit, it deals damage equal to failing the saving throw against this effect. The damage dealt by this attack doesn’t include your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

Flaming Grease 
You tweak your grease formula to be flammable, as grease should be. When you cast grease or use it to make an infused potion, the effect becomes flammable. If the grease takes fire damage, all creatures in the spell’s area take 2d4 fire damage. The grease burns for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1).

Additionally, when you cast the grease spell or use it as an infused potion, you can instead use it to coat a weapon. This coating lasts for 1 hour or until it takes fire damage, igniting the grease. Once ignited, that weapon deals an extra 1d4 fire damage on a hit for the next minute.

Fortifying Fumes Reaction (Instant Reaction) 
As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, throwing a fortifying stimulus of reagents at a point within 20 feet of you, which causes fumes to erupt. Each creature within 10 feet of that point can choose to hold its breath and not inhale the fumes, but creatures that do inhale them gain 1d4 temporary hit points, deal an extra 1d4 damage on their next melee weapon attack, and have advantage on their next Constitution saving throw. Any remaining benefits from this effect fade at the end of your next turn.

Both the temporary hit points and the extra damage increase by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

Frostbloom Reaction (Instant Reaction; upgrade only) 
As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, throwing a combination of devastating, endothermically reactive reagents at a point within 20 feet of you, which causes a bloom of ice to erupt. The area within 5 feet of that point becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

Each creature in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or be caught by the ice, taking 1d6 cold damage. If a creature that fails its saving throw is entirely in the area of effect, it becomes restrained until the end of its next turn. A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6), 11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).

Healing Draught (Instant Reaction) 
As a bonus action, you can produce an instant reaction that provides potent magical healing. A creature can use its action to consume this draught or administer it to another creature within 5 feet of it before the start of your next turn, causing the target to regain 1d8 hit points. If you have the Practiced Quaff feature, you can consume a Healing Draught as part of the bonus action used to make it.

A creature can benefit from a number of these draughts up to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), after which they provide no benefit to that creature until it finishes a long rest. A Healing Draught that isn’t consumed before the start of your next turn loses its potency.

The number of hit points the draught restores increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).

Homunculus Familiar 
You learn the alchemical process for creating a homunculus minion. You can cast find familiar without expending a spell slot or material components other than your alchemical reagents and blood. This familiar can appear in any Tiny shape you want, though it uses the statistics of a creature that can normally be chosen by the spell, and it is a construct or monstrosity, rather than one of the types listed in the spell.

Inoculations 
You gain resistance to poison damage.

Additionally, at the end of a long rest, you can choose up to five creatures (including yourself) to become inoculated against poisonous effects you can produce that require a Constitution saving throw (such as the Poisonous Gas instant reaction or the cloudkill alchemical infusion). You and each of the chosen creatures automatically succeed on saving throws against these effects until the end of your next long rest.

Long Acting 
If the spell you infuse into an infused potion would normally require concentration, its duration is now a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus.

Persistent Reactions 
Your instant reactions that have an area of effect persist in that area until the start of your next turn. While they persist, each creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there must repeat the saving throw against the effect. You can choose to make the effect not persist in this way when you take the action to produce the instant reaction.

Poisoner’s Proficiency 
You delve into the darkest, most mysterious depths of herbal lore, learning the potent secrets of poison. You gain proficiency with poisoner’s kits; if you already have this proficiency, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make using a poisoner’s kit. Additionally, during a long rest, you can create one of the following poisons of your choice:

 • Contact Poison. You can apply this poison to a melee weapon or up to ten pieces of ammunition. That weapon or ammunition deals an extra 1d4 poison damage on a hit; the weapon can deal this poison damage 10 times before the poison wears off.
 • Ingested Poison. This poison is a simple, flavorless powder. If a creature consumes a full dose of the poison, it must make a Constitution saving throw with disadvantage against your spell save DC. After 1 minute, if the creature failed its saving throw, it takes 1d10 poison damage per level you have in this class, and it becomes poisoned until it finishes a long rest.
 • Inhaled Poison. You can use this dose of poison to increase the size and potency of your Poisonous Gas instant reaction. When you do so, the fumes erupt in a 20-footradius sphere and the effect’s damage dice are doubled.

Any unused poison loses its potency and no longer has any effect after you finish your next long rest.

Poisonous Gas (Instant Reaction) 
As an action, you can produce an instant reaction, tossing a quick combination of reagents at a point within 20 feet of you, which causes noxious fumes to erupt in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 1d4 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of its next turn.
The damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4), 11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4).

Weapon Coating 
As a bonus action, you can apply one of your instant reactions to a melee weapon or piece of ammunition. The next time you hit a target with that weapon or ammunition before the end of your next turn, the target is subjected to the effects of the applied instant reaction. The creature automatically takes the damage or healing associated with the instant reaction, but makes a saving throw as normal against any additional effects.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
The Implications

There is an instant reaction that restores hit points, rather than deals damage. This can be applied via the Weapon Coating upgrade as well, though the weapon will still deal its damage on a hit. Perhaps your allies will forgive a blowgun dart coated in a healing draught...if you can hit with the attack.
### Layout: end frame

5TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Adrenaline Serum
 You learn to create a potent serum. As a bonus action, you can consume a dose of this serum, increasing your Strength and Dexterity modifiers by an amount equal to your Intelligence modifier (up to a maximum of +5) for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1), after which all effects of the serum fade at the start of your next turn. While you are under the effect of this serum, you also gain the benefits of the heroism spell. When these effects end, your speed is halved and you can’t benefit from your Adrenaline Serum again until the start of your next turn.

Explosive Powder (Prerequisite: Explosive Reaction) 
You’ve managed to stabilize and refine your Explosive Reaction. You can prepare a number of Explosive Reactions up to your Intelligence modifier (a minimum of 1). These Explosive Reactions don’t detonate instantly, but rather last for 1 minute and will only detonate when exposed to fire. A creature can be affected by the damage from no more than two Explosive Reactions simultaneously, but structures take the full damage of all Explosive Reactions in their area.

Resistance Potion 
You create a formula for making a simplified temporary resistance potion. During a long rest, you can create a potion that grants the drinker resistance to acid, cold, fire, lighting, poison, or thunder damage (selected during the long rest) for 10 minutes when consumed. If not consumed, it loses potency when you finish your next long rest.

9TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Aroma Therapies 
You expand your alchemical knowledge to be able to produce incense and simmering reagents that grant benefits to those that inhale their fumes. A creature that spends a long rest surrounded by these fumes regains an additional 2d4 Hit Dice, its exhaustion level is reduced by 1d4 (instead of 1), and it is cured of any nonmagical diseases it’s suffering from.

Infusion Stone 
You use the secrets of alchemy to create an Infusion Stone. You can use this stone in the process of infusing potions in place of expending a spell slot level. The spell you infuse in this way must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
Once you use the Infusion Stone, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

Mana Potion 
During a short rest, you can create a mana potion. A mana potion loses its potency if it isn’t consumed within 1 hour. As an action, a creature can consume a mana potion to regain one expended spell slot of its choice that is 3rd level or lower.

Potent Reactions 
You refine your instant reactions, increasing their potency. The die you roll to determine the damage or healing effect of your instant reactions is increased by one size: a d4 becomes a d6, a d6 becomes a d8, a d8 becomes a d10, and a d10 becomes a d12.

Rocketry (Prerequisite: Explosive Reaction and Delivery Mechanism) 
Combining your understanding of explosives with advances in delivery and stabilization, you produce the logical extreme: powering a rocket-based payload with your devastating knowledge.

You can choose any instant reaction you know as the payload for your rocket. Rockets must be prepared ahead of time, and you can prepare a number of them up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) at the end of a short or long rest. When you finish a rest, any unused rockets lose their potency and must be remade due to their volatile components.

A rocket targets a point you can see within 500 feet of you, but the DC of the instant reaction’s saving throw is reduced by 2 for every 100 feet it travels. When the rocket reaches its destination, the instant reaction takes effect, centered on that point.

Alternatively, you can load an alternate payload into your rockets, which can be an object that weighs no more than 1 pound, replacing the effect of the instant reaction. This alternate payload can be salvaged during a rest.

11TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Field Infusion 
You can create an infused potion as an action.

Once you create an infused potion in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Mutation Mixture (Prerequisite: 13th-level Inventor) 
You concoct an infused potion that can rapidly warp a creature’s body, temporarily mutating it in extreme ways. You add the polymorph spell to your list of available spells for your Alchemical Infusions. When a creature consumes this infused potion, the spell has a duration of 1 hour, but the creature that consumed it can end the effect early as an action.

Once a creature consumes this infused potion, it can’t be affected by the polymorph spell in this way again until it finishes a long rest.

Panacea 
When you create a Healing Draught, you can add a more potent concoction to it. A creature that consumes this potent draught can treat any dice rolled to determine the hit points it regains as having rolled their maximum value, and the creature gains the benefit of a greater restoration spell.

Once you create a Healing Draught in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Perfect Reaction 
In a moment of perfect focus, you can create a flawless instant reaction. When you deal damage, grant temporary hit points, or restore hit points to a creature with this instant reaction, you can use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.

Once you create a Perfect Reaction, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

15TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Adrenaline Rush (Prerequisite: Adrenaline Serum) 
While under the effects of your Adrenaline Serum, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

Mad Alchemy 
Whenever you create an infused potion, you can infuse two spells into it, instead of one, which activate simultaneously.

Philosopher’s Stone 
You create a Philosopher’s Stone, allowing you to recreate wonders of alchemy. As long as you have a supply of non-gold metal, you can create up to 1 pound of gold each day (50 gp worth). Additionally, the Philosopher’s Stone can be used in place of a diamond worth up to 500 gp for a spell’s material component; it isn’t consumed when used in this way, but it becomes inert for 24 hours, providing no benefits.

You can brew a special potion using your Philosopher’s Stone called an Elixir of Life. Brewing this potion takes 8 hours and requires crushing a diamond worth at least 2,000 gp into it. An Elixir of Life causes a creature that drinks it to cease aging for 4d4 years. A creature that drinks this elixir also gains the effect of a death ward spell, which lasts until it is triggered, instead of 8 hours.

A more potent Elixir of Life can be created, increasing the number of years that the creature ceases aging by 1d4 for each additional diamond spent.

 • Inventor Specialization: Potionsmith
 • Feature: Potionsmith Upgrades

THUNDERSMITH

A Thundersmith is an inventor who harnesses the primal force of elemental power, channeling that power into their great creation: a weapon of unmatched devastation. Spectacular and terrible, these weapons bring fear to their foes and awe to their allies.

Why a Thundersmith bends their mind to the task of making such a weapon are as varied as the creations themselves. Some are coldly analytical about the destruction it causes seeking to continually improve it, tweaking it for ever more optimized destruction, while others view it merely as a tool, a means to an end; others still revel in the crash of thunder that heralds the terrifying force of their weapon.

Many look at these weapons as the dawn of a new age, in truth wielding them is a tricky and arcane art; as complex as its creation it is only truly understood and mastered by the one who forged the device—each weapon a unique piece of devastating art.

THUNDERSMITH'S PROFICIENCY

When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with tinker’s tools and smith’s tools.

If your weapon requires ammunition, you gain the knowledge of how to forge and create it with smith’s tools during a long rest. You can create up to 50 rounds of ammunition during a long rest, with materials costing 1 gp per 10 rounds.

STORMFORGED WEAPON

Starting at 1st level, you harness the elemental power of thundering storms to create a powerful weapon. This weapon requires attunement, only you can attune to it, you are proficient with it while attuned, and you can only be attuned to one Stormforged Weapon at a time. If you have multiple Stormforged Weapons, you can change which one you are attuned to during a long rest.

If you lose your Stormforged Weapon or wish to create additional ones, you can do so over the course of three days (8 hours each day) by expending 200 gp worth of metal and other raw materials. When you make a new Stormforged Weapon, you can make the same or a different type, and select the same or different upgrades.

Select one of the following and consult the Stormforged Weapon table for its statistics.

STORMFORGED WEAPONS

XXXXXXXX

¹Stormcharged. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a Stormcharged Weapon, you can make only one Attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. If you could otherwise make additional attacks with that action, the weapon deals an extra 3d6 lightning or thunder damage per attack that was foregone. 
²Loud. Your weapon rings with thunder that is audible within 300 feet of you whenever it makes an attack.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Thunder Cannon

You use the power of thunder to launch a projectile with terrible power, if limited accuracy, over long distances. Ringing out with a booming crash, it brings fear to the battlefield.

Hand Cannon

Forgoing the guiding barrel, this pack uses the thundering power to launch a projectile with all the force of a Cannon, though its effective range is far more limited.

Kinetic Hammer

Rather than launching a projectile with the thundering force, you keep that force imbued in the weapon, allowing for devastating force to be applied to the attack.

Charged Blade

You create a bladed weapon that channels the harnessed power of the elemental storm power directly into the blade, causing it to lay waste to all it strikes. This weapon deals lightning damage instead of thunder when applying Thundermonger.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Firearms in a Campaign Setting

A lot of campaign settings do not feature firearms, and in some of these the Thundersmith variant of inventor might not be the right choice, but consider that the inventor is fundamentally someone that tinkers with and explores boundaries of magic as much as or more so than technology.

A Thunder Cannon need not be a gunpowder powered device, even in a setting where gunpowder exists, but can be powered by harnessing elemental powers, bound through various carefully researched magical techniques. In most cases, the wonders of an inventor are more an engineering marvel of magic than technology, but that balance can shift depending on what is best for your setting.
### Layout: end frame

Lightning Pike

You create a charged blade and stick it to the end of a pole, making it slightly more unwieldy, but giving it devastating reach. This weapon deals lightning damage instead of thunder when applying Thundermonger.

THUNDERMONGER

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
At 3rd level, the elemental might of your weapon is so powerful its strikes deal bonus thunder damage.

When you hit a target with your Stormforged Weapon, you can deal an extra 1d6 thunder damage. After discharging this bonus damage, you can’t deal this bonus damage again until the start of your next turn.

This extra damage increases by 1d6 when you reach certain levels in this class: 5th level (2d6), 7th level (3d6), 9th level (4d6), 11th level (5d6), 13th level (6d6), 15th level (7d6), 17th level (8d6), and 19th level (9d6).

Stormcharged vs. Thundermonger

A common question is why does the Stormcharged Property exist and how does it interact with Thundermonger? Functionally, the stormcharged property (like the loading property) has no effect on a single classed Thundersmith, it just exists to make Stormforged Weapons interact better with Extra Attack for multiclassing and Cross-Disciplinary Knowledge.
### Layout: end frame

DEVASTATING BLASTS

Beginning at 5th level, when you miss an attack with your Thundering Weapon, you can apply Thundermonger damage to the target creature you missed, but it deals only half the bonus damage. Dealing damage this way counts as applying Thundermonger damage.

UNLEASHED POWER

Starting at 14th level, when rolling damage for Thundermonger or your Stormforged Weapon, you can expend a spell slot to reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one) and maximize a number of dice equal to the level of the spell slot expended. (You may maximize the dice rerolled this way, or the dice that were not rerolled) You must use the new rolls.

How to Merge Your Weapons

If you want to call it a gunblade, I’m not here to stop you, but it can be any range of configuration, from a bayonet to something more exotic.

Adaptable Weapon 
You can adapt a weapon without the ammunition property to have an alternate attack type giving it the functionality of a Hand Cannon, or give a weapon with the ammunition property an alternate attack with the properties of a Charged Blade.
### Layout: end frame

Extended Range 
You extend the reach of your Stormforged Weapon. If your Stormforged Weapon has the ammunition property, its range is extended; normal range is extended by 30 feet, and maximum range is extended by 90 feet. If your Stormforged Weapon is a melee weapon with the two-handed property, it gains the reach property.

Lightning Burst 
You upgrade your Stormforged Weapon to discharge its power within a 5-foot-wide 60-foot-long line. If you have not dealt Thundermonger damage since the start of your turn, as an action, you can make a special attack. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take damage equal to the bonus damage of Thundermonger as lightning damage on a failed save, half as much on a successful save.

This counts as discharging your Thundermonger damage. Firing in this way doesn’t consume ammo.

Lightning Magic 
After a long study of the internal workings of your Stormforged Weapon, your mastery of lightning and thunder magic is such that you learn the following spells at the following levels and can cast them as Inventor Spells.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
XXXXX
Inventor Level	Spell
3rd	lightning tendril*
5th	crackle*
9th	lightning bolt
13th	jumping jolt*
15th	sky burst*

### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

### Layout: end frame

You can cast lightning tendril* without expending a spell slot, after which you must finish a long rest before you can cast it without expending a spell slot again. Starting at 5th level, you can choose to cast crackle* without expending a spell slot instead.

Point Blank (Prerequisite: Hand Cannon) 
Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t impose disadvantage on your ranged attack rolls. Additionally, you can use your Hand Cannon when making opportunity attacks.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Silencer (Incompatible with Echoing Boom) 
You upgrade your Stormforged Weapon with a sound dampening module. Your Stormforged Weapon loses the loud property. Additionally, you can expend a 2nd-level spell slot to overcharge the Silencer, casting the silence spell.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Note: Sound—and consequently thunder damage—can’t pass through silence or affect a creature inside its area of effect.
### Layout: end frame

Shock Absorber 
You add a reclamation device to your Stormforged Weapon to gather energy from the surroundings when it is present. As a reaction to taking Lightning or Thunder damage, you can gain resistance to that damage type until the start of your next turn. When you do so, the next time you roll Thundermonger damage before the end of your next turn, it deals an extra 1d6 damage.

Sonic Movement (Prerequisite: Stormforged weapon that can deal Thunder damage) 
You recalibrate and rebalance your weapon to leverage the backdraft of the force it exerts. When you make an attack with your Stormforged weapon that would deal thunder damage on your turn, you are knocked 5 feet away from the target you attacked. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

Storm Blast 
You can make a special attack with your Stormforged Weapon, unleashing a storm blast in a 30-foot cone as an action. Each creature in the area must make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC, or take damage equal to the bonus damage of Thundermonger and be knocked prone.

This counts as discharging your Thundermonger damage. Firing in this way doesn’t consume ammo.

If using a Kinetic Hammer, you can use your Strength to calculate the DC of this ability (8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus) instead of your spell save DC.

Twin Thunder 
You can attune to two one-handed Stormforged Weapons at the same time, so long as they either share the same Upgrades, or have total Upgrades equal to your maximum Upgrade count between them. Attuning to a second weapon this way doesn’t count against your maximum number of attuned items. If you make an attack with one of them while holding the other, you can attack with the other as a bonus action, however, both share the same use of Thundermonger. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative or you have the Two Weapon Fighting Fighting Style.

While dual wielding Stormforged Weapon, you can load a Stormforged Weapon without a free hand.

Weapon Improvement 
Your Stormforged Weapon gains a +1 to attack and damage rolls. This doesn’t stack with any benefit gained from Arcane Retrofit, and this upgrade can be replaced as part of applying a bonus to your Stormforged Weapon via Arcane Retrofit.

5TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Echoing Boom (Incompatible with Silencer) 
You pack extra power into your Thundermonger, increasing the damage it deals by 1d6.

Harpoon Reel 
You devise an alternate attack method for your Stormforged Weapon that launches a harpoon attached to a tightly coiled cord. This attack has a normal range of 30 feet and a maximum range of 60 feet, and it deals 1d6 piercing damage. This attack doesn’t apply Thundermonger damage. This attack can target a surface, object, or creature.

A creature struck by this attack is impaled by the Harpoon unless it removes the Harpoon as an action, which causes it to take an extra 1d6 damage. While the Harpoon is stuck in the target, you are connected to the target by a 60 foot cord. Dragging the connected party via the attached cord causes the creature moving to move at half speed unless they are a size category larger.

While connected in this manner, you can use your bonus action to activate the Reel action, pulling yourself to the location if the target is Medium or larger. A Small or smaller creature is pulled back to you, ending the connection. Alternatively, you can opt to disconnect the cord.

This attack can’t be used again until the Reel action is taken.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Connected...By a Rope

Note that Harpooning a creature means that there is a rope connecting you to them. While you can use this to move them as per the ability, they can also use this to move you, particularly if they are substantially larger. Many Thundersmiths were last seen saying “I got this” and then Harpooning a dragon. User discretion is advised.

Terrifying Thunder (Prerequisite: Echoing Boom) 
You add an additional amplifier to maximize the shock and awe value of your Stormforged Weapon. The first time a target takes damage from Thundermonger, they are deafened until the end of their next turn.
Additionally, they must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or become frightened of you for one minute. They can repeat this saving throw at the end of each of their turns.

On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to Terrifying Thunder for 24 hours.

9TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Elemental Swapping 
You upgrade the firing chamber for more adaptable damage. When you take the attack action with your Stormforged Weapon you can adjust its elemental properties, causing any bonus damage granted by Thundermonger to deal acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage instead of thunder damage.

Alternatively, you can use a vial of holy water to cause your next Thundermonger bonus damage to deal radiant damage.

Mortar Shells (Prerequisite: Stormforged weapon with the Ammunition property) 
You build an alternate fire mode allowing you to fire your Stormforged Weapon like a mortar. Pick a target point within range, and make an attack roll. Apply the attack roll to all creatures within a 5-foot radius of the target point. Creatures hit take the weapon's damage plus half of the Thundermonger bonus damage. Dealing damage this way counts as applying Thundermonger damage for the turn. If you miss all targets, you can apply Devestating Blasts as normal.

Creatures do not benefit from cover against this fire mode unless they have overhead cover as well.

Ride the Lightning (Prerequisite: Lightning Burst) 
When you use the Lightning Burst ability, you can opt to expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to infuse yourself into the burst of power. When you do so you are teleported up to 60 feet in the direction of the Lightning Burst (ending early if the Lighting Burst is blocked by an obstacle). You can stop anywhere along the path of the Lighting Burst, but the line will stop where you do.

Shock Harpoon (Prerequisite: Harpoon Reel) 
After hitting a creature with the Harpoon fire mode, you can use a bonus action to deliver a shock. If you have not dealt Thundermonger damage since the start of your turn, you can deal damage equal to your Thundermonger bonus damage as lightning damage. This counts as discharging your Thundermonger damage. Additionally, the target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or be stunned until the end of its next turn.

Once used, the Harpoon must be reeled in before this can be used again.

Synaptic Feedback 
You install a feedback loop into your cannon, allowing you to siphon some energy from your Stormforged Weapon to empower your reflexes.
Whenever you deal lightning damage with your Stormforged Weapon your walking speed increases by 10ft and you can take the Dash or Disengage actions as a bonus action. This effect lasts until the end of your turn.

Thunder Jump 
You build a quick release for the arcane thundering energy that fills your Stormforged Weapon. As an action you can discharge your Thunder Cannon downward, launching yourself up to 60 feet in any direction. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks, and you carry up to one willing creature of your choice within 5 feet with you. Neither you or the carried creature takes falling damage on landing.

Creatures that are within 10 feet of you when you use this ability must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On failure, they take damage equal to half of your Thundermonger damage. On success, they take half as much damage. This counts as discharging your Thundermonger damage. Firing in this way doesn’t consume ammo.

Transforming Weapon (Prerequisite: Adaptable Weapon) 
Select 3 of Thunder Cannon, Hand Cannon, Kinetic Hammer, Charged Blade, and Lightning Pike. As a bonus action, you can transform your Stormforged Weapon between them.

11TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Backblast 
After dealing thunder damage on your turn, you can create a burst of thunderous sound that can be heard up to 100 feet away as a bonus action. Each creature within 5 feet, other than you, must make a Constitution saving throw or take 3d6 thunder damage You can do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier, regaining all uses after a long rest. This damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 17th level to a total of 4d6.

Blast Radius 
Your Devastating Blasts feature now deals half your weapon damage (including your modifier) in addition to half your Thundermonger damage when you apply it to a missed target that is within 30 feet of you.

Stabilization 
When making a ranged weapon attack with your Stormforged Weapon, if neither you nor your target has moved since your last ranged attack against them, then you gain advantage on the attack. Also, being prone no longer causes you to have disadvantage when making a ranged weapon attack with your Stormforged Weapon.

15TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Massive Overload (Prerequisite: Storm Blast or Lightning Burst) 
Before making an attack with your Stormforged Weapon, you can expend a spell slot of 3rd level or higher to use Storm Blast or Lightning Burst at the same time as making an attack; in this case the Storm Blast or Lightning Burst is powered by the spell slot and doesn’t count as applying Thundermonger for that turn. The direction of this secondary ability is the same as your attack.

Doing this damages your Stormforged Weapon and you must spend an action to repair it before you can fire again. You must have the secondary ability unlocked as an upgrade to use it.

Masterwork Weapon (Prerequisite: Weapon Improvement) 
The bonus to attack and damage rolls for your Stormforged Weapon increases by +2 (stacking with any existing bonus from Weapon Improvement or Arcane Retrofit), up to a maximum of +4.

 • Inventor Specialization: Thundersmith
 • Feature: Thundersmith Upgrades

WARSMITH

A Warsmith is an Inventor that has turned their wondrous talent of invention to a singular goal: making themselves a juggernaut of war. The reasons behind this could be benevolent or nefarious. Some Warsmiths seek to turn their invention into a machine of death and terror; others become the arbiter of justice and order, and others still perhaps merely seek to refine their craft in pursuit of pure innovation.

Because few individuals would pursue such a wondrous invention without a driven purpose to their endeavor, warsmiths tend to be lawful. Usually driven to their actions by a greater purpose, they seek the power to accomplish their aims, be it righting the wrongs of the world or bringing it to heel beneath their ironshod boot.

WARSMITH'S PROFICIENCY

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor, tinker’s tools and smith’s tools.

WARPLATE GAUNTLET

At 1st level, when you take this specialization, you construct a Warplate Gauntlet. This is a specialized Wondrous Item that only you can attune to. When you create a Warplate Gauntlet, you can add one of the following upgrades to it: Power Fist, Force Blast, or Martial Grip. This upgrade doesn’t count against your upgrade total. You can make multiple gauntlets with different upgrades, but can only be attuned to one at a time.

If you lose your Warplate Gauntlet, you can remake it during a long rest with 25 gp worth of materials, or can scavenge for materials and forge it over two days of work (8 hours each day) without the material expense.

While wearing a Warplate Gauntlet, you can engage Artificial Strength.

Artificial Strength

When you don your Warplate Gauntlet or as an action while wearing it, you can dedicate some of your intelligence to fully controlling the power of the gauntlet. You can reduce your current and maximum Intelligence score to increase your current Strength ability score by the same amount, but you can only raise your Strength ability score up to what your Intelligence ability score was before engaging Artificial Strength. You can stop using Artificial Strength at any time, and it automatically ends if your gauntlet is removed.

WARSMITH'S ARMOR

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
At 3rd level, you’ve attained the knowledge of forging and arcane tinkering sufficient to create a set of armor that augments and expands your abilities from a standard, nonmagical, set of heavy armor using resources you’ve gathered. This process takes 8 hours to complete, requiring the use of a forge, foundry or similar and it incorporates a Warplate Gauntlet (they do not require separate attunement). While wearing your armor, your Strength ability score increases by 2, and your maximum Strength ability score becomes 22.

You can create a new set of armor by forging it from a set of gathered and purchased materials in a process that takes 2,000 gp and 8 hours. You can create multiple sets of armor, but you can only be attuned to one of them at a given time, and you can only change which one you are attuned to during a long rest. If you create a new set of Warsmith’s Armor, you can apply a number of Upgrades equal to the value on the class table, applying each at the level you get it on the class table.

When you create your armor, you can create a heavy plated Warplate, medium balanced Wargear, light flexible Warsuits, or you can integrate your changes directly into your body as Integrated Armor. If your armor is Warplate or Integrated Armor, you gain the Powerful Build trait. Powerful Build means you count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity and the weight you can push, drag, or left. Integrated Armor can’t be removed, but doesn’t confer any penalty when resting in it.

Additionally, if you are Small, you become Medium while wearing Warplate.

Warsmiths & Magical Armor

By the rules laid out here, using magical armor as a base for your Warsmith’s armor has no additional effect. This is intentionally the rules-as-written, but there is certainly some flexibility here.

 • Using Adamantine or Mithral, the properties carry over to the Warsmith’s armor.
 • Using +1/+2/+3 armor carries over, but counts as taking a free “Armor Class” upgrade for each +1 the armor has, meaning that upgrade can’t be taken to make the armor +4 or better.
 • Armor of Resistance carries over, counting as taking “Resistance” upgrade for that damage type for free.

Other cases can be handled on a case-by-case basis. Consult with your GM and work something out that would be reasonable to combine making receiving magic armor a cool bonus, but not something that breaks the game!

FULLY CUSTOMIZED GEAR

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
What Does Your Armor Look Like?

Nothing in this document specifies the visual appearance of your armor beyond the type of armor, but it very likely does not look like a standard set of armor. Consider what the visual differences are: Are your enhancements more mechanical in nature or more magical in nature? Does it have geared joints, glowing runes, or both? Consider how your setting might react to someone standing around in such armor. In all but the highest magical settings, such a set of armor is likely to attract some curiosity or concern.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Starting at 14th level, you’ve mastered the customization of your Warsmith’s armor. You can add one additional Upgrade to your armor that doesn’t count against your Upgrade total.

Additionally, during a long rest, you can now swap out any one upgrade for any other upgrade of the same level, so long as you don’t have an Upgrade that requires the Upgrade you are removing as a prerequisite, or an incompatible Upgrade.

WARSMITH UPGRADES

UNRESTRICTED UPGRADES

Accelerated Movement (You can apply this upgrade twice.)
 You reduce the weight of your armor by 15 pounds (to a minimum of 0 pounds). While wearing your armor your speed increases by 10 feet. This applies to all movement speeds you have while wearing your armor.

Adaptable Armor 
You integrate deployable hooks and fins into your armor, augmenting its mobility. While wearing your armor you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.

Additionally, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

Arcane Visor (You can take this upgrade multiple times, selecting a different option each time.)
 You magically enchant your visor. You gain one of the following effects while wearing your armor; you pick the effect when selecting the upgrade.

 • You gain darkvision to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the range of that darkvision is increased by 60 feet.
 • You can ignore Sunlight Sensitivity.
 • Divination spells no longer require your concentration to maintain. You can only use this effect on one spell at a time.

Regardless of the selection, you have advantage on saving throws against being blinded while wearing your armor.

Collapsible (Incompatible with Integrated Armor) 
Your Warsmith’s armor can collapse into a case for easy storage. When transformed this way the armor is indistinguishable from a normal case and weighs 1/3 its normal weight. As an action you can don or doff the armor, allowing it to transform as needed.

Construct Constitution (Prerequisite: Integrated Armor) 
You gain resistance to poison damage and immunity to the poisoned condition. You have advantage on saving throws against diseases as well as spell effects that require a “humanoid” target.

Flame Projector 
You gain the ability to unleash fire energy. While wearing your Warplate Gauntlet, you can cast fire bolt , and gain access to the following spells at the following levels while wearing your Warplate Gauntlet:

Force Blast 
You upgrade your Warplate Gauntlet to deliver a special ranged attack. This attack is a ranged spell attack that deals 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier force damage, and has a range of 60 feet.

You are proficient in this weapon. When you take the attack action, you can use this ranged spell attack in place of any attack made.

Fortified Brace (Prerequisite: Warplate) 
You build in systems to maximize defensive potential. As a reaction to taking damage, you can brace your armor, locking it in a defensive position. Until the start of your next turn, you gain resistance to all damage (Including the triggering damage) and any subsequent attacks made against you are made with disadvantage. On your next turn after taking this action, your speed is halved and you can’t take an action (you can still take a bonus action).

Grappling Hook (Prerequisite: Warskin or Warsuit) 
Your Warsuit gains an integrated grappling hook set into your gauntlet. As an attack or as an action, you may target a surface, object or creature within 20 feet. If the target is Small or smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) grappling check to pull it to you and grapple it. Alternatively, if the target is Medium or larger, you can choose to be pulled to it (this doesn’t grapple it). Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement are made with disadvantage.

Grappling Reel (Prerequisite: Integrated Armor or Warplate) 
Your Warsmith’s armor gains an integrated grappling reel set into your gauntlet. As an attack or as an action, you may target a surface, object or creature within 30 feet. If the target is Large or smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check as if grappling normally to pull it to you and grapple it on success. Alternatively, if the target is Large or larger, you can choose to be pulled to it (this doesn’t grapple it). This movement provokes opportunity attacks as normal movement would.

Iron Fortitude (Prerequisite: Integrated Armor) 
You gain an unnatural durability. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is from a critical hit. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead.

Lightning Channel 
You are able to funnel your suit’s power into your attacks. You can use this upgrade to cast lightning charged* as a bonus action without expending a spell slot.

Once used, this upgrade can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, you can apply the damage from lightning charged on your Force Blast ranged spell attacks.

Lightning Projector 
You gain the ability to unleash lightning energy. While wearing your Warplate Gauntlet, you can cast shocking grasp , and gain access to the following spells at the following levels while wearing your Warplate Gauntlet:

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

Martial Grip 
Your Warplate Gauntlet grants you the ability to wield a wide variety of powerful weapons. You gain proficiency with martial weapons while wearing your Warplate Gauntlet.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Power Fist (You can apply this upgrade twice.) 
Your Warplate Gauntlet becomes a melee weapon while you aren’t holding anything in it. You have proficiency in this weapon, and it has the Light and Special properties. It deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage.

 • Special. When you make an attack roll, you can choose to forgo adding your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the damage roll.

You can apply this upgrade up to 2 times, making a separate weapon with the same properties the second time.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Variant: Impact Gauntlet

Your GM may allow you to take the Impact Gauntlet upgrade of the Gadgetsmith in place of a Power Fist, which is similar but deals 1d6 damage and has the finesse property. For the purposes of upgrades, Impact Gauntlets and Power Fists should be considered interchangeable.
### Layout: end frame

Reinforced Armor (You can apply this upgrade up to 3 times.) 
You reinforce the structure and materials that make up your Warsmith’s armor. Your Warsmith’s Armor’s Armor Class (AC) increases by 1.

Sentient Armor 
You create an artificial personality integrated into your armor, giving it limited sentience. This sentience assists you in many ways. While wearing your armor, your Intelligence ability score and maximum Intelligence ability score are increased by 2. Your armor can understand and speak any language you can speak. You can communicate telepathically with it while wearing it.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Talking Armor

How much of a personality Sentient Armor has is up to the player and GM. Functionally, it only enhances things that use Intelligence as written , but many people enjoy fleshing it out much further as a sentient item as a sort of NPC. This doesn’t extend what it does (unless the GM says it does, of course) but can be fun to interact with. It can be assumed to see what you see when you’re wearing it, but can’t provide assistance with ability checks without related upgrades.

Wire Acrobatics (Prerequisite: Grappling Hook) 
You can take your movement using your grappling hook instead of using it as an attack or action; you can’t move other creatures when using the Grappling Hook in this way.

The first time you use your Grappling Hook to move on a turn, the movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

5TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Active Camouflage 
As an action, you can activate active camouflage, causing your Warsmith’s Armor to automatically blend into its surroundings. This lasts until deactivated. While this is active, you are considered lightly obscured, and can hide from a creature even when they have a clear line of sight to you. Wisdom (Perception) checks to find you that rely on vision are made with disadvantage.

Arcane Barrage 
Your armor collects arcane energy whenever you expend a spell slot, storing a number of charges equal to the level of the spell cast. These charges fade after 1 minute if you do not expend additional spell slots. You can store a maximum number of charges equal to half your Inventor level. You can use this upgrade to cast magic missile without expending a spell slot. This expends all charges, increasing the level of the magic missile spell by one for each charge spent. If you have an Ether Reactor, you can expend charges from it to add additional charges, up to the maximum number of charges you can have stored.

Once activated, it can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Artificial Guidance (Prerequisite: Sentient Armor) 
You upgrade the artificial personality integrated into your armor to assist with a new skill. While able to communicate with your armor, you can gain the effect of guidance when making any Intelligence or Wisdom check.

Emergency Protocol (Prerequisite: Sentient Armor) 
The intelligence in your armor will attempt to preserve your life. If you are incapacitated or unconscious and can’t take your action, it will cast a spell or take the dodge action. It can only cast spells granted by your armor’s upgrades, and can use your spell slots to do so. It can act in this way up a number of turns equal to your Intelligence modifier, but this control strains its abilities, and it can’t take control again until you finish a short or long rest. You automatically resume control if you are no longer incapacitated or unconscious.

Force Accumulator (Prerequisite: Force Blast)
 Every time you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you accumulate charges to your Force Blast equal to the level of spell slot spent, up to a maximum number of charges equal to half of your Intelligence modifier (rounded down). When you deal damage with Force Blast, you can expend the accumulated charges to deal an extra 1d6 damage or to move the target 5 feet directly away from you, or any combination thereof per charge spent.

Charges not expended within 1 minute of being accumulated are lost.

Mechanical Enhancement (Prerequisite: Integrated Armor) 
You improve every aspect of yourself ever so slightly. You gain +5 feet of movement, one additional hit point per Inventor level, and +1 to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.

Reactive Plating (Prerequisite: Warplate) 
Your armor partially deflects incoming blows. You can use your reaction when hit by an attack that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage to reduce the damage of that attack by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus.

Resistance (You can apply this upgrade multiple times.) 
You tune your armor against certain forms of damage. Choose acid, cold, fire, force, lightning, necrotic, radiant, or thunder damage. While wearing your armor you have resistance to that type of damage. If you apply this upgrade more than once you must choose a different damage type.

Sealed Suit (Prerequisite: Warplate) 
As a bonus action on your turn you can environmentally seal your Warplate, giving you an air supply for up to 1 hour and making you immune to poison (but not curing you of existing poisoned conditions).

In addition to the above, you are also considered acclimated to cold and hot climates while wearing your armor, and you’re also acclimated to high altitude while wearing your armor.

9TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Assume Control (Prerequisite: Emergency Protocol) 
You expand the control available to your armor’s sentience. You can set additional conditions when your armor will take control of your movement and actions, and it can maintain this control for up to 1 minute.

While acting in this mode, it can take any action you could take (including attacking), but can only cast spells granted by Upgrades. It uses your ability scores.

The triggering event can be a preset condition, a verbal command, or a specified time. Your armor is immune to the charmed, blinded, frightened, paralyzed, and poisoned conditions, and doesn’t suffer from exhaustion, ignoring these effects if you are under them.

If you have Warplate, it can act in this way even when you are not wearing it (or are dead). When doing so, it uses the game statistics of animated armor with the following modifications: It has an intelligence of 12 and it can cast any spells that come from Upgrades with a DC equal to your spell save DC.

This counts as a use of your Emergency Protocol, and it can’t control the armor again (in either way) until you finish a short or long rest.

In non-combat situations in which you are not wearing your armor, your armor’s sentience can exert a lesser control of the armor to move it about and perform simple tasks. During this time it has the statistics of an unseen servant, though it looks like your suit of armor. Its ability to do this is not limited, but it takes 1 minute to assume this kind of control of your armor, and it can only do so while you are not wearing it. If reduced to zero hit points, the armor is incapacitated until you repair it during a long rest, but it can still serve as armor.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Optional Control

With the Assume Control upgrade, the armor taking control on Emergency Protocol becomes optional, though if you do not choose for it to activate, it can’t activate later unless the condition was previously specified (e.g. “take control if I fail two death saving throws”).
### Layout: end frame

Brute Force Style 
The strength imparted by your armor gives the force of blows the devastating power of a more skilled combatant. You can select a Fighting Style from Duelist, Great Weapon Fighting, or Two-Weapon Fighting and gain the effect of that Fighting Style while wearing your armor.

Ether Reactor 
You construct an ether reactor that feeds your armor, powering its upgrades with arcane energy. The Ether Reactor has 6 charges, and can be used to power upgrades that cast spells, even upgrades that would normally only recharge after a rest can instead be cast by using charges, spending 1 charge per level of the spell you are casting. You can cast spells at a higher level by expending more charges. It regains all charges at the end of a long rest.

If your Ether Reactor has no charges left, you can overdraw your Ether Reactor for one last burst of power, but your armor is temporarily immobilized and your speed while wearing your armor becomes zero for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell cast. Once you overdraw it, you can’t do this again until you finish a long rest.

Head-Up Display (Prerequisite: Arcane Visor, Sentient Armor) 
You can delegate displaying and tracking things in your sight to your Sentient armor, granting you the following benefits:

 • When a creature attempts to take the Hide action against you, you can make an active Wisdom (Perception) check to contest its Dexterity (Stealth) check as a reaction.
 • When making a Dexterity saving throw against an attack you can see, you can make an Intelligence saving throw instead.
 • When a creature hits you with a ranged attack roll, you can cast true strike as a reaction targeting that creature.

Phase Suit (Prerequisite: Warskin or Warsuit) 
You gain the ability to cast misty step and blink while wearing your Warsuit. Additionally, as an action, you can become intangible, and move through creatures or objects until the end of your turn. If you end your turn inside a creature or object, you are forced to the nearest unoccupied location, taking 2 force damage for each foot you are forced to move.

Once you become intangible using this upgrade, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Recall 
When not being worn you can hide your Warsmith’s Armor in a pocket dimension. As an action you can magically summon the armor and don it. You can use a bonus action to return the armor to the pocket dimension.

While in the pocket dimension the armor can’t be affected by other abilities and can’t be interacted with in any way.

11TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Cloaking Device (Prerequisite: Active Camouflage) 
If you do not move during your turn with Active Camouflage engaged, you can use your reaction to take the Hide action using an Intelligence (Stealth) check. You make this check with disadvantage if you are within 5 feet of another creature or you attacked during your turn.

You can overload your camouflage to cast greater invisibility without expending a spell slot.

Once you do this, you can’t do this again until you finish a long rest.

Flash Freeze Capacitor (Incompatible with other Capacitors) 
You can store arcane energy, releasing it in a torrent of freezing energy. As an action, you can cast cone of cold without expending a spell slot or charges. The affected area becomes difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

Once you use this upgrade, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

Flight 
You integrate a magical propulsion system into your Warsmith’s armor. While wearing your Warsmith’s armor you have a magical flying speed of 30 feet.

Integrated Attack (Prerequisite: Integrated Armor or Warplate; incompatible with Iron Grip) 
You integrate a melee weapon into your Warsmith’s Armor. When you apply this upgrade you must have a weapon to integrate, and you must choose where on your armor the weapon is located. The weapon can’t have the heavy property. You are proficient with this weapon. As a bonus action you can activate the weapon.

You must treat it as though you are wielding it with one hand, but you can’t be disarmed of it. Once activated, you can use this weapon when you take the attack action, and it doesn’t require the use of a hand or your Warplate Gauntlet. You can apply this upgrade multiple times, selecting a new weapon and new location on your armor to install it.

When you activate your integrated weapon, you can immediately make one attack with it. While it is active, if you take the attack action on your turn, you can make an one additional weapon attack with your integrated weapon using your bonus action.

Iron Muscle (Prerequisite: Integrated Armor or Warplate) 
You reinforce the structure of your armor, giving it the strength of giants. While wearing your armor, your current Strength ability score is increased by 2, and your maximum Strength ability score becomes 24.

Lightning Rod (Prerequisite: Lightning Channel) 
Whenever you cast lightning charged* , you can treat the spell as if it was cast by a spell slot one level higher.

Powered Charge 
As an action, you activate a booster allowing you move up to 40 feet in a straight line. During this movement, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check to grapple any creature you would collide with (you still require a free hand to grapple a creature as normal; if you do not have a free hand, the check automatically fails and you collide with the target). On success, you do not stop and it is carried with you for the remaining distance or until your movement is stopped by a creature or wall.

At the end of the movement, any creature you collided with or are grappling takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 5 feet you traveled. If your movement is stopped by a wall, and creature you are grappling must make Constitution saving throw. On failure, they are stunned until the end of their next turn.

Once activated, it can’t be used again until you finish a short or long rest.

Power Slam Capacitor (Incompatible with other Capacitors) 
You store up kinetic energy, and unleash it in a mighty bound. As an action, you can jump up to your entire walking speed and cast shockwave* without expending a spell slot or charges upon landing.

Once you use this upgrade, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

15TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Heavy Plating (Prerequisite: Warplate) 
You install special heavy plating, giving you resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-magical sources while wearing your Warplate.

Iron Grip (Prerequisite: Iron Muscle; incompatible with Integrated Attack) 
You improve your grip strength and control of one of your gauntlets beyond the limits of flesh. While wearing your suit, you gain the following benefits:

 • You can wield Large-sized weapons without a penalty as a Medium-sized creature.
 • You can wield two-handed or versatile weapons in one hand and still treat them as if wielded with two.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Large Weapons

How GMs handle large-sized weapons varies. Consult with your GM for the stats of a large weapon. Typically approaches are to either double the damage dice, or increase the damage by 1d4, but other approaches exist between the two.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

### Layout: end frame

Phase Engine (Prerequisite: Warskin or Warsuit) 
When you are attacked, you can use your reaction to become intangible, causing that attack to miss if it is a nonmagical attack, or to have disadvantage if it is a magical attack.

Once you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest, or until you teleport or enter the ethereal plane.

Sun Cannon 
You install a sun cannon into your Warsmith’s armor, allowing you to unleash devastating solar laser blasts. As an action, you can cast sunbeam without expending a spell slot.

Once you use this ability, you can not use it again until you finish a long rest.

Virtual Interface (Prerequisite: Sentient Armor) 
When you use Artificial Strength to raise your Strength ability score, you no longer lower your Intelligence ability score below your natural maximum (not counting Sentient Armor).

OPTIONAL FEATURE: LARGE SUITS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Some players will want to build a larger suit, the Piloted Golem option below allows you to do that. The player and the GM should give some consideration to the consequences of being a Large-sized creature. It has advantages but considerable drawbacks that should not be ignored.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Large Inconvenience 
This is an optional route that can offer substantial benefits; it would generally be advisable to not pull punches on the drawbacks of being a Large-sized creature (difficulty gaining cover, in tight areas, etc). Discuss what sort of challenges you might face with this. Consider if a Piloted Golem—essentially a walking war tank—would have trouble interacting with things created for Medium-sized creatures: ladders, potion bottles, and more.
### Layout: end frame

Iron Aura (Prerequisite: Piloted Golem) 
Building defensive systems into your armor, you project a deflecting aura. Creatures of your choice within 20 feet of you gain half cover against ranged attacks that originate from outside the range of this aura.

Iron Fortress (Prerequisite: Piloted Golem) 
You count as three quarters cover for creatures within 5 feet (so long as you are between them and the attacker). Additionally, you can’t be moved against your will while in contact with the ground.

Piloted Golem (Prerequisite: Warplate, 9th-Level Inventor, incompatible with Collapsible and Flight) 
You enlarge your Warplate, turning it into a piloted mechanical golem. Your size category when wearing the armor increases by one.

You have advantage on Strength saving throws and Strength checks against creatures the same size as you or smaller than you, but you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and Dexterity checks (including initiative rolls). At the end of a short or long rest, your Warplate gains temporary hit points equal to your Inventor level.

You are no longer a valid target for spells that require a humanoid target, but can be targeted by spells that require a construct target while wearing this armor.

Self-Repair Matrix (Prerequisite: Piloted Golem) 
At the start of each of your turn you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus.

Sentry Mode (Prerequisite: Piloted Golem) 
As a bonus action deploy stabilizers, reducing your speed to zero but granting your better stability and focus. Until you end the effect as an action, your reach and range are both doubled with all weapons and you can make an opportunity attack against a creature that moves more than 5 feet within range of one of your equipped weapons (melee or ranged).

Shield Arm (Prerequisite: Piloted Golem) 
You integrate a shield into one of your armor’s arms. You have proficiency with that shield, and can deploy it as a bonus action. It requires the use of that arm while deployed.

Additionally, when you shove a Medium or smaller creature while you have the shield deployed, you can shove it by slamming it with the attached shield causing it to take damage equal to your Strength modifier.

 • Feature: Warsmith Upgrades

FLESHSMITH

A Fleshsmith is a discomfiting presence in a group. Even when encountered in the most ideal circumstances, they simply have a lingering gaze that says "How could I improve that?" when they look at you.

A Fleshsmith is a peculiar path of Inventor that has turned their creative talents... inward. They seek to understand and improve the limitations of flesh. All too frequently they place a slightly different value on aesthetics than others might, tending to find beauty primarily in efficiency.

A Fleshsmith tends to be more eccentric than inclined to any particular alignment, though even the most benevolent ones may find that the only reason their activities wouldn’t be illegal is that no one considered them possible.

FLESHSMITH'S PROFICIENCY

When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Medicine skill, as well as proficiency with Leatherworker’s tools (it’s best if you don’t think about the details on that one too much...)

Additionally, you can make all Medicine checks as Intelligence (Medicine) checks. When you take an Intelligence (Medicine) check to stabilize a creature, they regain 1 hit point.

THESIS OF FLESH

At 1st level, you select an approach to your work, a specialization to your art form. Select one of the following options:

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Perfection of Form

Nature had its chance to make your form, now it’s your turn to improve it. When you take this path, you gain the Fleshcrafted Mutation upgrade, and it doesn’t count against your upgrade total. Additionally, when an upgrade calls to use your spell save DC, you can instead use 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus.

When you take the Attack action, you can use your bonus action to make a single additional attack with this upgrade. You can make this additional attack a number of times equal to your Inventor level. You regain all uses at the end of a long rest.

Perfection of Creation

Why let the gods have all the fun? You’ve created life. When you take this path, you gain the Adorable Critter upgrade, and it doesn’t count against your upgrade total.

Your Adorable Critter gains temporary hit points equal to your Inventor level + your Intelligence modifier each time you finish a short or long rest. Your Adorable Critter gains a natural weapon dealing 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier piercing damage, though as normal it can’t independently take the Attack action. You can apply any upgrade you take to your Adorable Critter instead of yourself.

As an action, you can cause your Adorable Critter to move up to 10 feet and take the Attack action (requiring no action from the familiar). Additionally, you can also do this as a bonus action a number of times equal to your Inventor level and you regain all uses at the end of a long rest.

Perfection of Mind

You know that perfection is an aspect of knowledge, a perfect understanding of the mechanics of the body, inside and out. But particularly inside. You gain expertise in the Medicine skill. Additionally, you gain the Dissection upgrade, and it doesn’t count against your upgrade total.

You have a pool of d8s equal to your Inventor level. When you restore hit points to a creature or use an Intelligence (Medicine) check to deal damage to a creature, you can expend these d8s to restore additional health or deal additional damage. You can spend a number equal to your proficiency bonus at a time. You regain this pool of d8s at the end of a long rest.

Perfection of Technique

Others may call themselves “flesh smiths” or “flesh crafters”, but you are a flesh artist. Flaying, dicing, deboning, you’ve mastered it all. When you select this thesis option, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and gain the Flaying Hook upgrade, and it doesn’t count against your upgrade total. You can integrate your Flaying Hook into another weapon, attaching its heavy chain to the hilt of your weapon, allowing you to attack with either weapon, and being considered to be wielding both when wielding one. Any magical bonus to attack and damage rolls the attached weapon is also applied to the Flaying Hook (if higher).

When you use your Flaying Hook to pull a target or pull yourself toward a target, you can use your bonus action to make a single weapon attack against it. You can do this a number of times equal to your Inventor level and you regain all uses at the end of a long rest.
### Layout: end frame

UNCANNY VITALITY

Starting at 3rd level, your body has such vitality that it is constantly able to restore itself. While you have 1 or more hit points, at the start of your turn, you can choose to expend a Hit Die and regain hit points equal to the value rolled + your Constitution modifier (as normal for expending a Hit Die). If you have zero hit points, you can use this feature at the end of your turn.

Additionally, you regain Hit Dice equal to your Constitution modifier on a short or long rest (in addition to normal Hit Dice recovery on a long rest).

If you are missing any limbs at the start of a long rest, at the end of the long rest the missing limbs are regenerated.

ARCANE BIOENGINEERING

Additionally at 3rd level, you can use Arcane Retrofit to transmute a bonus to attack or damage rolls on a weapon to natural weapons gained from this subclass.

EXTRA ATTACK

Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

PERFECTION OF THESIS

Starting at 14th level, your understanding of your Thesis of Flesh grows; you regain uses of the resource it provides equal to your Intelligence modifier when you finish a short rest.

FLESHSMITH UPGRADES

UNRESTRICTED UPGRADES

Acid Gland 
Realizing that putting something that oozes acid inside yourself could not possibly go wrong, you do just that. As an action, or as an attack as part of the Attack action, you can spew acid, making a ranged spell attack against a target within 30 feet. On a hit, you deal 3d8 acid damage.

Alternatively, as an action, or as an attack as part of the Attack action, you can spray all creatures in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d4 acid damage on failed save.

Once you use either option, you can’t use this upgrade again until you finish a short or long rest. The damage increases by one die at 5th level (4d8 or 4d4), 11th level (5d8 or 5d4), and 17th level (6d8 or 6d4).

Adorable Critter 
You experiment on creating an adorable critter. You create— or modify—a Tiny CR 0 creature. This creature serves as a familiar as per the find familiar spell, but doesn’t disappear when reduced to zero hit points, and simply becomes unconscious. It can’t fully die unless destroyed. If it starts its turn unconscious, it regains its full hit points and regains consciousness. It can do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier.

You can resuscitate it (or rebuild it, as necessary) at the end of a short or long rest should anything untoward happen to it without expending a spell slot or material component. Its creature type is construct.

Better Eyes (You can select this upgrade multiple times.) 
Your eyes did not see everything you wanted them to, so you replace them with eyes that do. You gain a benefit to your vision, selecting one of following enhancements:

 • Blindsight (10 feet)
 • Darkvision (60 feet),
 • The ability to see clearly twice as far as your natural vision range.
 • Proficiency in the Perception skill.

If you select this upgrade again, you must select a different benefit.

Brimstone Bladder 
Why should dragons have all the fun? You can now exhale fire. As an action, or as an attack as part of the Attack action, you can exhale a gout of flames in a 30-foot line or 15-foot cone. Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, or take 3d6 fire damage. You can expend a spell slot to empower this fire breath, dealing a number of additional d6 equal to the level of the spell slot spent.

Once you use the option, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest. The damage increases by 1d6 at 5th level (4d6) and again at 11th level (5d6), and 17th level (6d6).

Dissection 
If you are holding a melee finesse weapon you have proficiency with, as an action you can make an Intelligence (Medicine) check against a creature within reach with a DC equal to its armor class. If you succeed on the check, you can deal damage to that creature equal to your weapon's damage dice plus your Intelligence modifier. On a roll of 20, treat the damage dice as you would on a critical hit.

If you could normally make more than one weapon attack as part of the Attack action, you can deal a number of additional dice equal to the number of attacks you could normally make as part of an Attack action when taking this action (for example, if you have the Extra Attack feature and take this action with a dagger, you would deal 2d4 + your Intelligence modifier damage).

Expertise to Hit

Dissection can generate very high hit chance due to its nature, but deals less damage than attacking twice with Extra Attack would (as it only adds your modifier once), making it a trade off.

Crushing Grip 
You don’t let things go once you have them in your grip. Creatures that are grappled or restrained by you have disadvantage on attempts to escape the condition.

Additionally, you can choose to apply damage equal to your Strength modifier to any creature that starts its turn grappled or restrained by you.

Death Flail (Prerequisite: Perfection of Technique) 
Rather than cast out the Flaying Hook, you master the art of spinning your attached martial weapon by the chain in a windmill of death. Your weapon gains the Reach property when used in this way.

Additionally, instead of attacking a target with it normally, as an action, you can spin the weapon wildly in giant deadly sweeps. Up to four creatures within 10 feet must make a Dexterity saving throw against a DC of 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. On failure they take damage equal to your weapon’s damage dice + your Strength modifier of your weapon’s damage type.

If you have the Spiked Chain upgrade and hit one or more targets, you can select one of them to be affected by the special property of Spiked Chain.

Extra Eyes 
Why only see one direction? You add extra eyes. You gain proficiency in the Perception skill. If you are already proficient in the skill, you add double your proficiency bonus to checks you make with it. In addition, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Flaying Hook 
A metal hook attached to a chain. You are proficient with this melee weapon, and it has the Special property. It deals 1d6 piercing damage.

 • Special. This weapon has a range of 20 feet. When you hit a target that is more than 5 feet away from you, if the target is Medium or smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by its Strength (Athletics) to pull the target toward you. On a successful check, a Small or smaller target is pulled to you, and a Medium target is pulled half the distance (rounding up) toward you. The creature takes 1 additional damage for each 5 feet it is pulled.

If the creature is Medium or larger, when you hit a target more than 5 feet away from you you can pull yourself up to 10 feet toward the target.

Fleshcrafted Enhancement (Prerequisite: Applicable Fleshcrafted Mutation) 
You use your knowledge of inhuman anatomy and the twisted powers you gain from it to formulate an unnatural enhancement of your Fleshcrafted Mutation, granting it an additional power. The table below shows which enhancements can be applied to which mutations.

Each enhancement has an empowered effect. An empowered effect automatically occurs when you roll a 20 to hit with your mutation on an attack with the enhancement, or once per turn on your turn, you can manually activate the empowered condition by expending a spell slot of 1st level or higher.

XXXXX
Enhancement	Qualified Mutations	Effect	Empowered Effect
Vampiric	Extra Fangs	Once per turn, on your turn, when dealing damage with your Extra Fangs, you can drain the life from your victim adding 1d4 necrotic damage. If the target is a living creature over CR 1/4, you regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.	You add your Constitution modifier to the hit points regained.
Infernal	Extra Fangs, Extra Claws	Once per turn, on your turn, when dealing damage with your Fangs or Claws you can ignite your claws with infernal flames, the attack deals an extra 1d6 fire damage.	You deal an extra 1d6 fire damage.
Venomous	Extra Fangs, Extra Claws	Once per turn, on your turn, when you hit a creature with your natural weapon you can inject venom, dealing an extra 1d8 poison damage.	The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or become poisoned for 1 minute. They can repeat their saving throw at the end of each of their turns.
Razor	Extra Fangs, Extra Claws	The damage die of your natural weapon becomes one step higher (for example, Extra Fangs go from 1d10 to 1d12).	You can maximize one die of your choice after rolling damage for this mutation.
Relentless	Extra Arm, Extra Tentacle	You gain an additional reaction you can only use to make an opportunity attack with that Fleshcrafted Mutation.	You can make an additional single attack with your Fleshcrafted addition. This attack only deals the weapon damage of the attack, and doesn’t add your modifier to the damage dealt.

One Enhancement
 Note that unless otherwise specified, an Upgrade can be taken only once. In this case, all the enhancements are effectively mutually exclusive.

Empowered Relentless Attacks
 Your Empowered Relentless attack will deal either the normal weapon die of the natural weapon, or the weapon die of a weapon held in an extra arm. This can be a two handed weapon only if you have two extra arms.

Fleshcrafted Mutation (You can select this upgrade multiple times.) 
You enhance your body by crafting or mutating a new part through grotesque experimentation. Select one of the following mutations:

XXXXXXXX
Mutation	Description
Extra Arm	You get an extra arm on your body. This arm is capable of doing things an arm can do, like holding and hitting things.
Extra Claws	You gain a natural weapon that deals 1d8 slashing damage, and counts as a light finesse weapon. You have proficiency with this weapon, and are considered to be holding this weapon in one hand for the purposes of attacking.
Extra Fangs	Your mouth becomes a natural weapon that deals 1d10 piercing damage. You have proficiency with this weapon.
Extra Tentacle	You gain a tentacle appendage which is a natural weapon that deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage with the reach property. You have proficiency with this weapon. Using this tentacle, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check or object interaction with a reach of 10 feet.

Extra Arm & Perfection of Form

When attacking with a Perfection of Form with an extra arm, you can make an attack with a weapon held in that arm. You only make a weapon attack with two hands if you have two or more extra arms to use for it.

Field Surgery 
Some say that not all medical problems require surgery. Not you. As an action, you can repair a body to its natural limits far more quickly than its natural healing. You can repair a willing creature within 5 feet of you, allowing them to expend hit dice up to half your Inventor level (rounded up). Each Hit Die spent is rolled as normal, but you can add the higher value of their Constitution modifier or your Intelligence modifier.

Fix Flesh 
Your expertise in the working of flesh makes you an artisan of fixing broken creatures. When you cast cure wounds you restore an additional amount of health equal to your Intelligence modifier.

Forbidden Knowledge 
You delve into the arcane mechanics of how bodies work. Otherwise known as necromancy. You learn additional spells as shown on the table below:

XXXXXXXX
Inventor Level	Spells Learned
3rd	inflict wounds
5th	blindness/deafness, gentle repose
9th	invest life*, vampiric touch
13th	blight

You can cast inflict wounds without expending a spell slot, after which you must finish a long rest before you can cast it without expending a spell slot again. Starting at 5th level, you can choose to cast blindness/deafness without expending a spell slot instead.

Horrifying Abomination (Prerequisite: At least 3 upgrades modifying your body) 
The perfect form you have crafted intimidates inferior beings. You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill, and if you are already proficient in it, you can add twice your proficiency bonus.

Massive Mutation 
You develop a method to suddenly mutate. As a bonus action, you can become a Large-sized creature. Creatures of your choice within 30 feet of you that witness this must make a Wisdom Save against your spell save DC or become frightened of you until the end of their turn.

While you are large, you deal 1d4 additional damage with your natural weapons and weapons sized for Medium creatures, and you have advantage on contested Strength (Athletics) checks against Large or smaller creatures. You can revert to normal size as a bonus action.

You can spend a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier + your Intelligence modifier as a Large creature before you must revert and can not become Large again until you finish a short or long rest. After a short or long rest, you regain all rounds of duration you can remain as a large creature.

Mutating Mastery 
After so many little adjustments, you find that your form is quite flexible to your needs. You gain the ability to cast alter self without expending a spell slot.

Once cast in this way, you can’t cast it again with this upgrade until you finish a short or long rest.

Secondary Life Organs 
Realizing the fragility of mortal life, you modify yourself with additional necessary functions. You no longer take extra damage from critical hits.

Additionally, when you make a death saving throw, you can replace the results of that roll with a 20. Once you do this, you can’t do this again until you finish a long rest.

Spiked Chain (Prerequisite: Flaying Hook) 
You lace the chain of your Flaying Hook with spikes. When you attack a creature within 5 feet with your Flaying Hook, you can opt to make a Spiked Chain attack instead. This attack deals 2d4 piercing damage on hit, and has the Special property.

 • Special. When you hit a creature with this weapon, that target loses 10 feet of movement (hindered by the chain) and takes 1d4 damage each time they move 5 feet, up to 2d4 damage (for 10 feet of movement). You can’t use this weapon against another creature until the start of your next turn, but have advantage on opportunity attacks against that target. If it doesn’t move before the start of your next turn, you reel your chain back in, dealing 1d4 slashing damage to that target.

Subdermal Plating 
Exoskeletons are bulky, and endoskeletons just don’t offer enough protection, so you compromise. You gain natural armor granting you a base AC of 17 (your Dexterity modifier doesn’t affect this number). This increases to 18 when you reach 5th level. If you are using a shield, you can apply the shield’s bonus as normal.

Scales & Shells

Like with many upgrades, what this upgrade really represents is a base AC of 17. Anything else can, within reason and with consultation of your GM, be adjusted. This upgrade could be "Heavy Scales" or "Shell", or any other version of natural armor that could plausible provide heavy armor.

Toxicity 
Copying certain frog species, you make your blood poisonous. Once per turn, when a creature deals piercing or slashing damage to you while within 5 feet of you, they take poison damage equal to your Constitution modifier. If damage is from a biting attack, they take twice as much damage.

You may also opt to make yourself take on a different skin hue, to let creatures know they shouldn’t eat you.

Unnatural Health 
You’re a shining beacon of vitality. You gain an additional 1 maximum hit point for each level of Inventor you have.

Additionally, when you roll a 1 or 2 on a Hit Die for recovering health, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if it is a 1 or a 2.

5TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Corrosive Critter?! (Prerequisite: 5th level, Perfection of Creation) 
Your adorable critter’s natural weapon deals an extra 1d6 acid damage on hit.

Life Merchant 
You can share your considerable vitality with other creatures. You are a generous person, after all. You learn the spell invest life* , and you can cast invest life* without expending a spell slot.

Once you cast in this way, you can’t cast it again with this upgrade until you finish a short or long rest.

Pressure Points (Prerequisite: Perfection of Mind) 
Your extensive knowledge of anatomy allows you to target critical spots. When you deal damage to a target with a melee weapon, as a bonus action you can force them to roll a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC.

If they fail, they suffer the effects of the slow spell until the end of your next turn. If you hit them again while they are under the effect of this feature, they become restrained until the end of your next turn. If the creature is already restrained they become stunned until the end of your next turn. If they are already stunned they become paralyzed until the end of your next turn.

If the target becomes paralyzed from these attacks or passes a Constitution saving throw against it, they become immune to this ability for 24 hours.

Reflexive Twitch (Prerequisite: Extra Arm) 
When you take damage from a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to reflexively attack them with your Extra Arm. This attack doesn’t add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to damage dealt, unless that modifier is negative.

Safe Revival Technique (Prerequisite: Field Surgery) 
You can cast revivify without expending a spell slot or material component. For some reason the target gains a level of exhaustion, and is frightened of you for one minute upon reviving.

9TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Devouring Maw 
Due to the inefficiency of having only one intake port, you build an additional one, properly equipped with razor sharp fangs and a special property. This maw becomes a natural weapon that deals 1d10 piercing damage.

If you hit with an attack with this maw, you can choose to make a grapple against the target as a bonus action. Targets grappled by this maw take 1d4 piercing and 1d4 acid damage at the start of their turn.

Attacks with this maw are made with advantage against targets it is grappling, but it can’t be used to attack other creatures while grappling a creature.

If you have the Fleshcrafted Enhancement upgrade, you can apply a benefit from it to this Maw. This can be a different selection than the one applied to your Fleshcrafted Mutation.

Extreme Mutation (Prerequisite: Mutation Mastery) 
You can push your mutation to the limits and well beyond using a touch of magic. You learn the spell polymorph , but unless you know this spell from another source, you can only target yourself. Additionally, you can cast this spell without expending a spell slot, but once you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Life Void (Prerequisite: Life Merchant) 
You hunger for missing vitality. After casting invest life* , the first time you damage a living creature within the next minute, you deal an extra 3d8 necrotic damage, and regain hit points equal to the necrotic damage dealt.

Massive Hulk (Prerequisite: Massive Mutation) 
You no longer have a limit to how long you can stay in your larger form.

11TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

...Adorable Critter? (Prerequisite: Perfection of Creation) 
As an action, your familiar can become Small, Medium, or Large. It can revert to its normal size as a bonus action. While Medium or larger, its natural weapon deals 1d12 + your Intelligence modifier piercing damage. Its Strength ability score increases by 4 for each size category larger it becomes, to a maximum of 18.

Dark Miracle 
When you use an action that restores hit points to another creature, you can expend up to 4d4 of your own hit points to increase the amount of health restored by that much. Creatures that receive this strange surge of vitality have advantage on their next attack or saving throw.

Unrelenting Predator (Prerequisite: Fleshcrafted Enhancement) 
Your Fleshcrafted Enhancement's Empowered effect no longer requires a spell slot, though it can still only be done once per turn.

Vivisection (Prerequisite: Perfection of Mind) 
When dissecting a creature using an Intelligence (Medicine) check granted by Perfection of Mind, if the creature’s remaining hit points are lower than the result of your Intelligence (Medicine) check, you can choose to vivisect the creature, killing it instantly instead of dealing damage.

If you kill a creature in this manner, you have advantage on a Medicine check to harvest organs, ingredients, or other items from it.

Wings Seem Useful 
You decide that wings seem useful, and install a pair on your back. You can shape them like any naturally functional wings, such as a bird, bat, or insect. These grant you a flying speed equal to your walking speed, so long as you are not wearing heavy armor.

15TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Adaptive Response 
You attain full mastery of your body and its functionality, able to detect when it malfunctions. As a reaction to failing a saving throw against becoming blinded, deafened, paralyzed, poisoned, or infected by a disease as the result of failing a Constitution saving throw, you can end the effect, even if you would normally not be able to take reactions due to the effect.

Once you do this, you can’t do this again until you finish a short or long rest.

Best Eyes (Prerequisite: Better Eyes) 
Despite your high quality eyes, you’ve noticed some things still see better than you, so you take their eyes and use those instead. You gain truesight of 30 feet in addition to your normal vision.

Flesh Shaper 
You gain the ability to cast clone without expending a spell slot. You still require material components.

Once you cast this spell, you can’t cast it again until you finish a long rest.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Uncanny Strength (Prerequisite: Strength 18 or higher; you can take this upgrade twice.) 
You don’t see what the big deal is with two handed weapons. After some small improvements to one of your arms and grip, you can hold a two handed weapon in one-hand in the upgraded hand.

Undying Fortitude 
When you drop to 0 hit points, rather than falling unconscious, you make a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to the amount of damage over your current hit points taken. On a success, you drop to 1 hit point instead, and you remain conscious.

 • Inventor Specialization: Fleshsmith
 • Feature: Fleshsmith Upgrades

CURSESMITH

A Cursesmith’s power is invariably marked by the dark decisions they’ve made; some ignore this lingering darkness, pursuing the heights of power their reckless creation allows. Others leverage the twisted side effects themselves, believing there are no mistakes, only opportunities. Darker still are those that truly embrace the darkness of their twisted creations, becoming twisted creations themselves.

A Cursesmith is not always evil, but they walk a path that dangles precariously over evil, making it an easy thing to fall into. They may be lawful, but the laws they respect are rarely those of normal mortal society that might get in the way of their dark delving.

CURSESMITH'S PROFIENCY

When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with one artisan’s tool of your choice, and learn one language of your choice from Infernal, Abyssal, Deepspeech, or Primordial.

Additionally, you have advantage on any check to determine the nature of a curse.

FORBIDDEN ARTIFACT

At 1st level, you set yourself apart from other Inventors by seizing power that others dare not wield. You partake in a dark ritual investing enormous power and a part of your soul into a weapon. The weapon becomes permanently bound to you. You have proficiency with the weapon. If the weapon is lost or destroyed, you can reform it by drawing on its connection to your soul. This is a special ritual that takes 1 day, and summons the weapon to you if it was lost, or recreates it if it was destroyed.

When you perform the rite, select two of the following upgrades: Empowered Artifact, Abhorrent Life, Grasping Form, Twisting Reach, Necrotic Wounding, or Eldritch Eruption. You can select additional properties as Upgrades, but your Forbidden Artifact can have a maximum number of these Upgrades equal to your proficiency bonus (meaning the first time you can select an additional property is 5th level).

Abhorrent Life

Your Forbidden Artifact takes a life of its own, writhing and lashing on its own at your mental direction. You can apply your Intelligence modifier to the attack and damage rolls of the weapon where you usually apply your Strength or Dexterity modifier.

Eldritch Eruption

You can release magical blasts of power from the weapon that deal damage equal to the weapon’s damage dice. Select from cold, fire, lightning or necrotic for its damage type when you select this upgrade. In place of making an attack with this weapon, you can release this energy as a ranged spell attack. The ranged spell attack has a range of 60 feet. You can apply your Intelligence modifier to damage done with this attack.

Empowered Artifact

The weapon hums with great power. When you roll damage with an attack made with the weapon, you can reroll one of the weapon’s damage dice.

When attacking objects or structures, you can instead maximize its damage dice.

Grasping Form

Your Forbidden Artifact can twist around, binding targets. When you hit an attack with it, you can attempt to grapple the target as a bonus action. If you have the Abhorrent Life property, you can make an Intelligence (Athletics) check to initiate or sustain the grapple. You can’t attack other creatures while grappling a creature with this weapon.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Necrotic Rot

The weapon is enshrouded in dark energy. Each time you hit a creature with it, it inflicts a stack of necrotic rot on the creature. At the end of that creature’s turn it takes 1d4 damage per stack of necrotic rot on it and makes a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a success, all stacks are removed. You can have a maximum number of stacks on a creature equal to your proficiency modifier.

Twisting Reach

If your Forbidden Artifact is a melee weapon stretches and flexes unnaturally in seeking its targets. Its range increases by 5 feet.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Tracking Necrotic Rot

My favorite way to track this is just place the d4 next to the creature each time it gets a stack as it gives a great feeling of impending doom. If you have a less absurd collection of d4s on hand, simple tic marks can suffice.
### Layout: end frame

SOUL INVESTITURE

Due to your unique bond to your Forbidden Artifact, as a bonus action you can feed part of your soul into the weapon to empower it, weakening you and empowering it. While weakened in this way, you are under the effect of the bane spell. While empowered, the weapon deals an extra 1d6 necrotic damage on hit.

You can make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw as an action to reclaim the invested soul, ending the investiture on success. If you finish a long rest while your soul is invested into the weapon, the number of Hit Dice you regain is halved.

Drawbacks of Investiture 
Soul Investiture is usually not a good idea, and forms only part of the power budget of the weapon. When interacting with various upgrades it can be quite powerful, but it is a risky and high-cost option.

CURSED PATH

Starting at 3rd level, the path you’ve chosen begins to claim your body and soul: some could call it a curse, some could call further opportunity. Select a path from the following.

Curse Bearer

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Your soul can carry great burdens. When you are under the effect of bane, you can choose to ignore the effect for a roll. Once you choose to ignore the effect, you can’t do so again until the start of your next turn.

Additionally, when you suffer the effect of any curse from one of the upgrades granted by this class, you can suppress the effect, ignoring its negative consequences. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a long rest. If the curse is an ongoing effect, it is suppressed until the start of your next turn.

Other Curses

At your GM’s discretion, you may be able to use this feature to shrug off the effects of other lesser curses.
### Layout: end frame

When you select this path, you learn the following spells at the following levels. These spells do not count against your spells known, and are Inventor spells for you.

XXXXXXXX
Inventor Level	Spell
3rd	protection from evil and good
5th	warding bond
9th	protection from energy
13th	death ward
17th	dispel evil and good

Curse Bringer

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
You can force your soul's burdens onto others. When you make an attack roll while under the effect of bane, if you hit the creature after rolling a 3 or 4 on the d4 from bane, the target suffers the effect of bane until the end of your next turn.

Curse Eater

You consume your Forbidden Artifact, destroying it and afflicting yourself with a terrible curse. You gain a melee natural weapon as the manifestation of this cursed power. On hit, this weapon deals 1d8 damage of your choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage (selected when you gain this feature), and 1d4 necrotic damage. All effects that apply to a Forbidden Artifact apply to this natural weapon. You can apply Soul Investiture to this natural weapon.

Additionally, you can absorb any item you create with this specialization, innately gaining its effect and curse. At the start of your turn while you are not incapacitated you gain temporary hit points equal to 1 + the number of cursed items you have consumed with this ability. If you are under the effect of bane, this becomes 1d4 + the number of cursed items you have consumed with this ability.

Furthermore, when you gain temporary hit points from this feature, you can instead regain hit points equal to the temporary hit points you would have gained. You can regain hit points this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a long rest.

CURSESMITH UPGRADES

UNRESTRICTED UPGRADES

Abhorrent Split (Prerequisite: Forbidden Artifact with damage die of d8 or higher) 
When awakened, your Forbidden Artifact splits into multiple writhing branches. The weapon's damage dice convert to smaller increments based on the table below:

You can only take spells of a level you could normally cast at the level you take this Upgrade.

To cast these spells as rituals, you require fresh blood; this can be provided by a creature that has been slain in the last hour, or by a creature (including yourself) providing it at a cost of 1d4 slashing damage (This damage can’t be reduced or prevented).

Cursing Rod 
You make a twisted magical rod that can dispense curses. Select one of rotting curse* , binding curse* , or befuddling curse* when you create this item. You can cast that curse once using it without expending a spell slot.

Once you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

Dark Magic 
You record some of the foulest effects your experiments have had, codifying them into magical spells. You learn the following spells. They are Inventor spells for you, but do not count against your spells known.

Form of the Fiend 
As an action, you can expend a spell slot to assume the form of a fiend from the following list. The transformation lasts for a number of rounds equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus and requires your concentration to maintain, as if concentrating on a spell, or until you drop to 0 hit points or die. The new form can be a fiend from the following table based on the level of spell slot spent. Your game statistics, excluding mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen fiend. You retain your alignment and personality.

You assume the hit points of your new form. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.

You do not gain any spells the form can cast, legendary actions, or legendary resistances it might have. Your gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

 Attunement, Cursed.

As an action, you can infuse an Inventor spell you know (including spells gained from upgrades) with a casting time of 1 action into the ring. You cast the spell as normal (expending the spell slot if it is 1st level or higher) but the spell doesn’t take effect, and is stored in the ring for later use. When you take the Attack action while a spell is stored in your ring, you may replace one attack with the stored spell. You may also release the stored spell directly, casting it at its normal casting time. A stored spell fades if you remove the ring, or if it is unused at the end of a long rest.

This effect can occur a number of times equal to the spell slot used on the infusion.

Select a cantrip with a spell attack roll from the Wizard spell list that deals the same damage type as your weapon (when awakened). Once per turn, you can apply the secondary effect of that cantrip to your weapon’s attack roll (for example, applying chill touch’s secondary effect to a weapon that deals necrotic damage).

Ghostgrasp Gloves (You can only wear 1 set of Gauntlets at a time.)
Attunement, Cursed. 
When you pull on these pale white gloves, your hands become ethereal, ghostlike appendages that drift and float from your wrists.

Attunement, Cursed 
You forge a pair of gauntlets that cause your hands to appear as skeletal appendages of dark metal. While wearing these gauntlets, if you grapple a creature, at the start of its turn it takes 1d6 necrotic damage, and can’t regain hit points until the start of its next turn.

Additionally, you have advantage against any check or save that would disarm you. While wearing these gauntlets, you can cast the grip of the dead* spell.

While another creature is wearing the ring, you can attempt to possess them. They make a Charisma saving throw.

Aspect of the Damned (Prerequisite: Curse Eater, 2 upgrades consumed) 
The powers you have pilfered for your soul have tainted it... naturally this gives you great power. In addition to the powers you have gained from your upgrades, select two of the following powers to permanently gain:

Spell-Eating Ring 
You make a magical item that consumes magic around you. You can activate the item, casting counterspell or dispel magic against a target within 15 feet of you. When you cancel a spell in this way, you can consume the spell to recover 1d4 hit points per level of the spell.

Alternatively, if the spell would have had a non-instantaneous duration and would have affected a creature, you can transfer one spell to yourself. A spell stolen in this way doesn’t require concentration to maintain, but lasts only a number of turns equal to your Intelligence modifier or the spell’s duration, whichever is shorter.

Once you use this Upgrade, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

11TH-LEVEL UPGRADES

Blood Cloak (You can only wear 1 cloak at a time.)

If you hit a creature while you have temporary hit points, you can expend them, adding them to your damage roll.

You can decrease your Charisma ability score by up to your proficiency bonus, increasing your Strength ability score by an amount equal to your decreased Charisma. You can’t increase your Strength ability score beyond its normal maximum in this way. This lasts until you use an action to reclaim your Charisma from the item.

Whenever you slay a creature of CR 1/4 or higher, you gain +1 current and maximum Strength ability score. Both of these effects fade after 1 minute without killing a creature.

 • Curse. At the end of each turn your strength is increased by weapon, you take necrotic damage equal to 1 + the amount of additional maximum Strength you have gained. This damage can’t be resisted.

Ghost Cloak (You can only wear 1 cloak at a time.)
Attunement, Cursed. 
You craft a cloak that chips away at your bonds to the material world around you. At the start of your turn while wearing the cloak, you can choose to slip those bonds entirely, stepping into the ethereal plane. Moving through creatures doesn’t impose a movement penalty, and you can move through objects up to 5 feet thick as difficult terrain. If you end your turn in another creature or object's space, you are moved to the nearest available space, taking 1d10 force damage per five feet moved.

Once you activate this item, you can’t activate it again until you finish a short or long rest.

While you are shrouded in these flames, any creature within 5 feet of you that hits you with an attack takes 2d8 necrotic damage.

Pandemic of Despair (Prerequisite: Curse Bringer) 
If a target becomes affected by bane (either the spell or the effect from Curse Bringer) you can force a creature within 5 feet of it to make a Charisma saving throw against the same effect, repeating indefinitely as long as you are affecting any creature (besides yourself) with bane . If a target fails their save, they become affected by the same effect as the initial target.

True Artifact 
Long ago you forged great power; now you realize its full potential. Your cursed weapon becomes a true artifact. Any bonus to attack and damage rolls lower than +3 it has is replaced by a bonus of +3, and it gains two additional properties from the following list:

 • While attuned to this artifact, you are immune to disease.
 • While attuned to this artifact, you can’t be charmed or frightened.
 • While attuned to this artifact, you can cast a 1st or 2nd level spell of your choice from any spell list once per short rest without expending a spell slot (choose the spell when this upgrade is selected). • While attuned to this artifact, you can treat a 1 on a death saving throw as a 20.
 • While attuned to this artifact, one of your ability scores (chosen when this upgrade is selected) increases by 1, to a maximum of 24.

When you select this upgrade, you can select the conditions by which your weapon can be destroyed. Your weapon can no longer be permanently destroyed by any other means. This means can be absurd or implausible, but must be something potentially possible.

Undying Creature (Prerequisite: Curse Eater) 
You gain twice as many temporary hit points at the start of your turn from Curse Eater (or recover twice as many hit points when recovering hit points with it). You gain temporary hit points from the feature even when incapacitated.

 • Inventor Specialization: Cursesmith
 • Feature: Cursesmith Upgrades

RUNESMITH

A Runesmith is an Inventor that has narrowed their focus to working a specific language of magic - powerful runes that can channel long lasting power. These runes come in many shapes and forms, the lore behind them from many sources.

A Runesmith can be a knight, their runes splashed with gleaming power across their armor, or a scholar lending their power to their companions, marking potent runes on their weapons before standing back, or even a strange tattooed mystic, their runes tattooed across their very body.

Runesmiths are not inherently good or evil, though their rigorous attention to detail and patience tend to make them more inclined to a lawful perspective.

RUNESMITH PROFICIENCY

When you choose this specialization at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons as well as smith's tools or calligrapher's supplies (based on your preferred method of marking runes). You learn one additional exotic language of your choice.

RUNIC MARKS

Starting at 1st level, you can mark magical runes, imbuing the things they are marked onto with magic. A rune can be marked on a weapon, on a suit of armor, a shield, or directly onto yourself, as a type of runic tattoo.

The affected creature of a rune is the creature wielding the weapon or armor it is marked on, or you if the rune is directly marked on you. A weapon or set of armor can only bear one rune, but there is no limit to the number of runes that can be marked on a creature.

If a rune is marked on a creature, select either the weapon effect (affecting its natural weapons or unarmed strikes) or armor effect (affecting its natural armor).

You know the following runes, and can learn more from upgrades. You can mark your runes during a long rest, and can have two runes marked at a time, gaining the ability to have an additional rune marked at 3rd level (to three runes), 5th level (to four runes), and 14th level (to five runes). These last until you mark a new rune, with the oldest rune fading when you mark a new one after reaching your maximum number of runes. Upgrades that grant new runes do not increase this number, but only expand the range of runes you can mark.

Runic Effects

Each rune grants a passive ability based on what it is marked on that enhances the ability of what it is marked on, and has an active ability that can be activated by you as an action or in place of an attack as part of the Attack action while it is marked. A rune can only be activated in this way once per turn.

RUNESMITH UPGRADES

UNRESTRICTED UPGRADES

Animate Inscription 
You mark a special rune on yourself or an item in your possession to represent a familiar. You can spend a Hit Die to give it life and cast find familiar using this rune. When you cast find familiar in this way it doesn’t require a spell slot or require material components, and the casting time is one action.

Arcane Glyph 
You learn how to translate a spell you know with a range of self into a glyph that can be marked on a creature or piece of armor. As a special 1 minute ritual, you can cast a spell you know with a casting time of 1 action, casting the spell as normal. The spell doesn’t take immediate effect, but instead becomes imbued as a special glyph on a creature or armor you are touching. This glyph has no passive effect, but when activated with an action, it casts the stored spell, originating from the creature or armor marked with this glyph, and using your spellcasting ability, spell attack, and spell save DC.

Alternatively, the creature marked with this glyph or wearing armor marked with this glyph that is aware of its presence can use this glyph to cast the spell marked within as if they cast the spell stored using a magical item. The spell originates from the creature or armor marked with this glyph, but the casting uses your spellcasting ability, spell attack, and spell save DC.

The glyph immediately fades after the spell has been cast (the spell lasts as normal). The glyph fades when the Runesmith that marked it finishes a long rest.

Channel Magic 
You can cast a spell with a range of touch on a creature marked by one of your runes, wearing armor marked by one of your runes, or wielding a weapon marked by one of your runes, regardless of the distance between you.

Additionally, you can cast any spell the rune grants, the creature marked by the rune is the point of origin of the spell

Example: Runic Lightning Bolts

This would mean that when you cast lightning bolt from Greater Rune Magic, you could cast that lightning bolt either from your current position, or from the Rogue's position, giving you great flexibility.

Glyph Magic 
You gain the ability to cast glyphs. You learn the following spells at the following levels. These spells are Inventor spells for you, but do not count against your spells known.

XXXXX
Type	Effect	Level Requirement
Absorption	You learn the glyph of absorption* spell.	—

PSION

A huge orc flies across the room, smashing through tables and chairs before hitting the wall with a thunderous crash, collapsing dazed. A human, her eyes still glowing with unearthly power, tosses a few extra coins on the bar. “Sorry for the mess. If he wakes up, tell him to try picking on someone his own size next time.”

The prisoner’s expression turns from defiant to puzzled as the interrogator asks no questions, merely stares at them silently. His puzzled expression turns worried as he finds himself, unbidden, recalling where he stashed the loot. “Under the stables behind the Rusty Hook Inn” the interrogator finally speaks, as the thief’s expression becomes terrified.

“Ain’t you... cold or somethin’?” the dwarf asks the elf as they trudge through the snow, eying her simple robe and bare feet. “I just think ‘warm’” the elf replies with a distracted air. The dwarf snorts, a puff of chilled air. Typical elf nonsense. Except... they haven’t frozen to death yet. “Say... could you think some ‘warm’ this way?” the dwarf asks hopefully. To the dwarf’s surprise, the chill of the snow fades away completely. “That’s downright creepy... hey don’t stop now! Was jus’ sayin’ it was creepy.”

Psions are those who have tapped into a special otherworldly force, with the ability to actualize the power of their mind to accomplish impossible feats. Reading minds, lifting vast weights, and transcending physical limitations, they tend to inspire awe and terror in equal measure.

The exact nature of what psionic power is might be a question answered in your setting, or it might not be. Most view psionic power as coming from within, though other answers exist—anything from the leaking power of the realms beyond, to an alternate way to express magic, to an actualization of an individual’s will upon the world.

POWERFUL MINDS

Since a psion’s weapon is their mind, they are always a careless thought away from harming those around them. For a psion, the line between thinking and doing can be very thin, forcing them to keep their thoughts and emotions in check, lest their powers run amok. This leads to many of them developing odd behaviors or mannerisms to help them control their state of mind, frequently seeming quite eccentric to an outside observer.

Consider how your psion keeps their powers in check, and how much their power bleeds into their everyday life. How reading minds may affect their body language or habits. Do they add wood to the campfire from the comfort of their bedroll, or do they restrain themselves from using their power for trivial matters lest they slip up?

MISUNDERSTOOD POWER

In a world of widespread magic, many will assume a psion to be a type of Sorcerer or Wizard, mistaking their powers for the common applications of magic. The common villager keeps only one mental category for the supernatural and creepy people that bend reality to their will. But even among magic users, a psion’s powers will frequently be found unnerving.

It is often those who do understand magic that find a psion’s abilities the most aberrant. A force that intersects the magical weave rather than obeys it, the nature of the power that the psion wields one can only contemplate with unease.

Psionics & Magic

The mechanical interactions between magic and psionics are covered in the Psionics feature but may vary depending on your GM and setting. Psionics are still an expression of the supernatural and may still be affected by effects that suppress magical effects but are often mysterious and baffling to those familiar with magic, being a more raw interaction of the mind and weave.

CREATING A PSION

When creating a psion, consider your character’s background. How did you become a psion? Were you born with latent powers? Or did something happen to you granting your powers? Or did you intentionally train yourself through rigorous mental exercise to leverage them? Consider how developing a rare and mysterious power would have affected your interactions with people.

Consider what your purpose is with your newfound powers, or how you plan to use your powers. Do you intend to be taken for a Wizard casting magic, or are you freely open about being of a... different nature?

QUICK BUILD

You can make a psion quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Intelligence your highest ability score, followed by Dexterity or Constitution. Second, choose a background that lends itself to intelligence skills.

CLASS FEATURES

As a Psion you gain the following class features.

HIT POINTS

Hit Dice: 1d6 per psion level
 Hit Points at 1st Level: 6 + your Constitution modifier
 Hit Points at Higher Levels: 1d6 (or 4) + your Constitution modifier per psion level after 1st

PROFICIENCIES

Armor: Light armor
 Weapons: Simple weapons
 Saving Throws: Intelligence, Wisdom
 Skills: Psionics, and choose two from Deception, History, Insight, Intimidation, Investigation, Medicine, Perception, or Religion.

EQUIPMENT

You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background:

 • (a) a quarterstaff, (b) a dagger, or (c) a martial weapon (if proficient)
 • (a) leather armor or (b) scale mail (if proficient)
 • (a) a scholar’s pack or (b) an explorer’s pack

If you forgo this starting equipment, as well as the items offered by your background, you start with 3d4 × 10 gp to buy your equipment.

PSIONIC ARCHTYPE

At 1st level, you pick the archetype of psion you embody, choosing from Awakened Mind, Unleashed Mind, Transcended Mind, Shaper’s Mind, Wandering Mind, or Consuming Mind, each of which are detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 1st level, and again at 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 14th level.

PSIONICS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Psionic Disciplines

You are granted access to a psionic discipline (such as Telepathy or Telekinesis) by your chosen archetype. A psionic discipline comes with a passive feature that expands your character’s capabilities and an active psionic power that can be modified and empowered with psi points. Additionally you can use your discipline in more detailed applications to recreate the effect of certain spells, listed at the end of the discipline description. At 3rd level you can select a second discipline, and 18th level you can select a 3rd discipline.

Psionic powers are suppressed by antimagic fields and can be dispelled with dispel magic, but are only affected by counterspell if recreating the effect of a spell. Any check required to dispel magic, counterspell or to identify a spell being cast with psionics is made with disadvantage unless the caster also has the Psionics feature. The detect magic spell will detect the usage of psionics, but not their nature: it will show up as a mysterious untyped power, even if being used to generate the effect of a spell.

When recreating a spell through a psionic effect (using a psionic discipline to cast the spell) the spell has no material or verbal components, but using any psionic ability requires somatic components and causes the psion to vibrantly glow with the otherworldly psionic energies they are controlling.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Psi Points

Starting at 1st level, you gain access to psi points used to fuel psionic discipline powers and effects. You have a number of psi points equal to your psion level, and you regain all spent points when you finish a short or long rest. You can spend a number of psi points equal to half your Psion level (rounded up) at a time. For example, if you’re a 5th-level Psion, you can spend 3 psi points on a psionic power or cast a spell with a cost of 3 psi points.

Psionic Ability

Psionic powers, Psionic Talents, and spells gained through this class use your psionic ability.

Psionic ability save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Psionic ability attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
### Layout: end frame

PSIONIC TALENTS

Starting at 2nd level, you gain access to a psionic talent allowing you to further specialize. Pick two talents from the list of psionic talents presented at the end of the class description. You can pick a new psionic talent at 5th, 7th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level. When you level up, you can replace a psionic talent you have previously selected with a different option.

SECOND DISCIPLINE

When you reach 3rd level, you can select a second psionic discipline from the list of psionic disciplines. You can’t select a Discipline you already know. You gain all features of a psionic discipline when selecting it.

ABILITY SCORE IMPROVEMENT

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

PSIONIC MASTERY

When you reach 5th level, you gain mastery of your psionic powers. At the start of your turn you get 1 free psi point. This can be spent to empower psionic disciplines, but not to recreate spells or fuel Psionic Talents. If you have any unspent free psi points granted by this feature left at the end of your turn, then they are lost.

At 11th level, this is increased to 2 free psi points, and at 17th level, this is increased to 3. Points can be split between different abilities.

INNATE PSIONICS

At 11th level, you gain the ability to exert great feats of psionic power. Choose one 6th-level spell from the psion spell list as an innate ability. You can use this innate ability to cast that spell once. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more innate abilities of your choice that can be used in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Innate Psionics when you finish a long rest.

Innate Psionics are well beyond the normal scope of your powers and are not restricted by what disciplines you have. Unlike psionic disciplines, they require any component the spell requires.

THIRD DISCIPLINE

When you reach 18th level, you can select a third psionic discipline from the list of psionic disciplines. You can’t select a discipline you already know. You gain all features of a psionic discipline when selecting it.

ASCENSION

Starting at 20th level, if you die you can choose to become an incorporeal entity on the Border Ethereal at the spot you died in the Material Plane at the start of your next turn. This entity has the physical ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution) and abilities of a ghost, but has your mental ability scores (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma) and your psion class abilities.

When you take this form your current and maximum hit points becomes that of the ghost while you are in the form, if you have less than 10 psi points when you would assume this form, you have 10 psi points. While in this form you can’t rest to regain spent abilities. If you exhaust all Psi Points or the ghost is destroyed, you die as a normal creature would.

 • Class: Psion

AWAKENED MIND

An Awakened Mind is a psion who had their psionic power awakened within them by an encounter, event, or circumstance. Perhaps their powers were latent or perhaps their destiny had been that of a normal creature until powers were suddenly thrust on them. Perhaps they brushed the realms beyond in a vivid dream, perhaps they wandered the Feywild and came back warped, perhaps they merely glimpsed the eyes of a creature that did not belong walking down the street.

An awakening is often somewhat traumatic. Psions are not well understood and the first power they manifest—telepathy— is one of the most feared and shunned abilities.

An Awakened can be either empathetic or cruel, good or evil. Knowing what is on the minds of others affects people in different ways, driving some away from society as they see its true face, while others feel drawn to help the problems only they can see.

OPENED MIND

At 1st level when you select this archetype, your mind awakens the ability to directly connect to the minds of other creatures, granting the psionic discipline of Telepathy.

MENTAL AWARENESS

Additionally, starting at 1st level, you can use Intelligence instead of Wisdom when making an Insight check against a creature with an Intelligence ability score of 6 or higher.

Further, if you have telepathically communicated with a willing creature, you know their general location (direction and rough estimate of distance) for the next hour as long as you are on the same plane as them.

MIND READER

Starting at 3rd level, when you use Telepathic Intrusion, you can force the target to make an Intelligence saving throw instead of a Wisdom saving throw against the power (deciding when you use the ability).

When a creature fails a saving throw against your Telepathic Intrusion, you gain a d4. Until the end of your next turn, if you make an attack roll against the creature or the creature makes a saving throw against one of your psionic powers other than Telepathic Intrusion, you can add or subtract the d4 from the roll (deciding to roll before you roll the attack or use the power).

EMPOWERED PSIONICS

Starting at 6th level, when you deal damage with a psionic discipline power you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt.

ALL SEEING EYE

Starting at 10th level, you can see a creature by its mind. You gain a mindsight of 60 feet, allowing you to see creatures with an Intelligence of 6 or higher within range as if by blindsight. A creature you are unaware of can still be hidden from you, but you can use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier when making Perception checks to detect creatures.

FULL AWAKENING

Starting at 14th level, you can briefly fully awaken your expanded mind to true comprehension. At the start of your turn, you can expend 2 psi points to gain advantage on all saving throws and attack rolls until the start of your next turn.

 • Psionic Archtype: Awakened Mind

UNLEASHED MIND

An Unleashed Mind’s power is most often an innate force they struggle to understand or control, a reflection of their state of mind and mood projected onto the world around them, often to devastating results. The life of an Unleashed Psion is frequently their journey to control their unruly powers... or one of embracing the destructive powers fully.

What the wellspring of their innate power is varies: they could be a psionic race, born under the influence of distant twisted powers, warped by fey blood, or a herald of something more sinister brushing against the material world. Sometimes their power will show itself in simple applications, but most often their power becomes known and feared when their temper flares.

Their alignment frequently depends on the approach to their powers they have taken. An Unleashed Psion who emphasizes control and restraint, keeping their emotions from running wild and their powers from running rampant will most often be lawful, following strict personal codes. On the other hand, an Unleashed Psion who lets their power run rampant will almost always be chaotic in nature, acting on impulse... with great emphasis.

UNSHACKLED POWER

At 1st level when you select this archetype, you gain the ability to unleash your mind to physically interact with the world around you, granting you the psionic discipline of Telekinesis.

OVERWHELMING POWER

Additionally at 1st level, you gain the ability to cast thaumaturgy with your psionic powers. When you cast it in this way, you have an additional options:

 • You cause up to 10 pounds of loose objects within 10 feet of you to start floating for 1 minute.
 • You can force all targets within 5 feet to make a Strength saving throw, or be pushed 5 feet away from you.

RAMPAGING POWER

Starting at 3rd level, you gain a d4 rampage die. Once on each of your turns when making a damage roll, you can add this rampage die to the damage roll. If you dealt damage during your last turn, your rampage die becomes a d6, increasing with each subsequent turn you deal damage by one step, up to a d12; if you did not deal damage during your last turn or become incapacitated, it becomes a d4 once more. If you maintain a continuous d12 rampage die for more than one minute, you gain one level of exhaustion.

EMPOWERED PSIONICS

Starting at 6th level, when you deal damage with a psionic discipline power you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt.

UNCONTROLLABLE MIND

Starting at 10th level, the strength of your rampaging mind is such that others’ attempts to control it are futile. You gain immunity to the charmed and frightened conditions, as well as effects that would control your mind while your rampage die is a d8 or more.

UNSTOPPABLE RAMPAGE

Starting at 14th level, when an attack reduces you to zero hit points, you can roll your rampage die. If your roll + your Constitution modifier is higher than the excess damage you took, you are instead reduced to one hit point. You can expend 2 psi points to roll an additional rampage die, adding it to the result.

 • Psionic Archtype: Unleashed Mind

TRANSCENDED MIND

A Transcended psion is most often one that has found their path to psionic powers through a mental epiphany, realizing the place of their mind within the multiverse and how it ties to everything else, seeing the keys and levers to the world laid out before them in their mind’s eye.

Most often achieved either intentionally or accidentally through meditation and ritual, this can sometimes even be a passed on technique to reliably transcend the strictly material concerns, and explore the more cognitive realm and powers within.

Transcended Psions tend to have the best grasp on their powers in control and principle, having come to understand the greater cosmos, but lack the reckless abandon some other Psions may have. Unfortunately less transcendent minds frequently cannot understand the greater truths they have learned and may view a Transcended Psion as a bit... peculiar.

ENLIGHTENED

At 1st level when you select this archetype, you gain the ability to empower your body with the power of your mind, granting you the psionic discipline of Enhancement.

STATE OF MIND

Additionally at 1st level, you can ignore the effects of extreme heat or cold, hold your breath twice as long as normal, and can go twice as long without eating or sleeping before suffering exhaustion.

BALANCE OF POWER

Starting at 3rd level, when you use a psionic ability (power or spell) to restore hit points or grant temporary hit points, you can add equivalent hit points granted to a stored pool. The maximum value of the pool is your psion level, and any points beyond the maximum are lost. The next time you make a damage roll, you can expend the pool to add damage equal to the stored value to one target affected by the damage roll. This stored damage is lost if not spent within 1 minute.

PERFECTED ENHANCEMENT

Starting at 6th level, when you grant temporary hit points with a psionic power you can add your proficiency bonus to the temporary hit points gained by one creature.

MENTAL CONTROL

Starting at 10th level, when you have to make a Constitution saving throw to avoid losing concentration on an effect from a psionic discipline, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the saving throw.

MIND OVER MATTER

Starting at 14th level, when you would roll a Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution saving throw, you can expend 2 psi points to roll an Intelligence saving throw instead.

Additionally, when you roll a Death saving throw, you can expend 4 psi points before rolling to treat the roll as 20.

 • Psionic Archtype: Transcended Mind

SHAPER'S MIND

A Shaper is a Psion that specializes in the materialization of their imagination, projecting it out into the world. No mere conjurers borrowing the powers of other planes, a Shaper manifests things from nothing but their own mind, weaving their creations into existence through the exertion of raw psionic power and imagination.

A Shaper’s mind is a tool of nearly unrivaled power possessing both boundless creativity and inexorable will, but if that will is overrun, the world would do well to fear a Shaper’s nightmares.

CREATOR’S MIND

At 1st level when you select this Archetype, you gain the ability to will the contents of your mind into the world, granting you the psionic discipline of Projection.

BOUNDLESS IMAGINATION

Additionally at 1st level, when you conjure your Astral Construct, you can apply one of the following powers to it:

 • Devastating Weapons. You imagine more deadly armaments—from a greatsword to vicious fangs—causing your Astral Construct to grow more deadly. The Astral Construct’s damage becomes 1d12
 • Psionic Conduit. You can use your psionic powers, spells, talents through your Astral Construct, as if you were in its space.
 • Vivid Existence. Your Astral Construct fully materializes and automatically uses Solidify at the start of your turn without requiring a command to do so.

You can change which benefit you grant it for the duration of the effect as a bonus action.

ASTRAL METASTABILITY

Starting at 3rd level, when you use your psionic powers to create an Astral Construct, it doesn’t require concentration to maintain, and lasts until dismissed, but you can’t summon another one while you have one summoned.

EMPOWERED CONSTRUCT

Starting at 6th level, when you deal damage with an Astral Construct or a weapon created by Project Item, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt.

ASTRAL GUARDIAN

Starting at 10th level, when you would take damage while you have an Astral Construct within 30 feet of you, you can use your reaction to conjure it to you (sharing your space) and expend 1 psi point to Solidify it, transposing it between you and the source of damage. It takes the damage instead of you. If the attack deals more damage than it has hit points (from Solidify), you take the remainder of the damage.

IMAGINARY ARMY

Starting at 14th level, you can allow your mind to run wild, letting an astral army spring forth into reality. When you use Replicate, you can create one additional Astral Construct that can be controlled with the same action (commands still only affect one Astral Construct of your choice). This additional construct lasts until the start of your next turn and can’t be sustained. Once you create an additional duplicate, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

 • Psionic Archtype: Shaper's Mind

WANDERING MIND

A Wandering Mind is among the more mysterious incarnates of psions, these are individuals that just aren’t quite rooted in the same reality everyone else is... they find it more pliable and slippery, and prone to jumping right through it on occasion.

How they get their powers varies. Some were born in the ethereal plane or went through a portal while young. Sometimes it is just that their mind just works along an axis most people cannot understand. No matter its source, they manifest a truly unique ability to treat certain aspects of the metaphysical with a certain mundanity, and are prone to treating their powers as absolutely natural things as one might treat an arm or leg.

SPATIAL MANIPULATION

At 1st level when you select this archetype, your mind grows a greater perspective on the nature of space and dimensions, allowing you to manipulate it and your relation to it, granting you the psionic discipline of Transposition.

Additionally, your connection to your transdimensional powers are such that you can slide through the spaces you see in dimensions as another might slip through a tight space, without conscious thought or effort. You can use your Dexterity ability score in place of your Intelligence ability score calculating the DC or attack roll modifier of Transpositional powers, alternate effects, or talents that require the Transpositional discipline.

NOMAD’S GEAR

Additionally at 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons and medium armor.

CUNNING STRIKES

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Starting at 3rd level, you gain the Rift Strike talent. If you already have the Rift Strike talent, you can gain one other Psionic Talent of your choice. The Rift Strike talent doesn’t count against your Psionic Talents known, but can’t be switched out on leveling up.

CURIOUS MIND

Starting at 3rd level, your wandering mind adapts to new situations constantly. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can select two skills you lack proficiency in. Until the end of your next long rest, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to ability checks made with those skills.

PHASE DANCER

Starting at 6th level, once per turn, you automatically gain one illusory duplicate as per the blurring modifier when you use your Phase Rift power. Additionally, your first attack roll before the end of your turn after using Phase Rift gains advantage.

FLICKERING PRESENCE

Starting at 10th level, your unspent Psionic Mastery points are not lost until the start of your next turn, but can only be used to cast flicker.

Additionally, when you roll for the effect of flicker* or blink you can expend 1 psi point to reroll the result. You can select which of the two results you would like to use.

PLANESWALKER

Starting at 14th level, your understanding of how to traverse space expands to a previously incomprehensible scale. You gain the ability to cast plane shift and teleport . You can cast one of these spells per day once without expending a spell slot or use of Innate Psionics. Once you do this, you must finish a long rest before you can use them again, or use your 7th level or higher use of Innate Psionics instead of the spell selected for that level to cast these spells again before finishing a long rest. If you already have one of these spells selected for your 7th level Innate psionic power, you can select a new 7th-level spell from the psion list for that slot. Material components are still required for casting plane shift this way.

WINDING PATHS

Additionally at 14th level, your phase rift no longer has to go in a straight line, though it can only pass through a creature’s space once.

 • Psionic Archtype: Wandering Mind

ELEMENTAL MIND

An Elemental Mind is a Psion that can manifest and control elements as an extension of their will.

ELEMENTAL POWER

At 1st level when you select this archetype, you gain a deep intrinsic tie to elemental power, granting you the ability to manipulate it. You gain the psionic discipline of Psychokinesis.

PRIMORDIAL ASPECT

Additionally at 1st level, as an action or when you deal fire, cold, or lightning damage (no action required), you take on an aspect of that element until the end of your next turn or until you take a new primordial aspect.

 • Cold. You gain an icy shell, reducing any nonmagical bludgeoning, piercing or slashing damage taken by your proficiency bonus.
 • Fire. You gain a fiery aura. Once per turn, a creature within 5 feet that hits you with a melee attack takes fire damage equal to your proficiency bonus.
 • Lightning. You flicker with lightning. Your walking speed is increased by 5 feet for the duration.

You can additionally spend 1 psi point to gain resistance to the element to the start of your next turn. If you are specialized in an element, you can do this without spending a psi point for the element you are specialized in.

Aspect Appearance

The appearance of the aspect manifesting itself may vary, perhaps your hair becomes fire and radiates heat, or your skin takes on an icy sheen, but whatever the nature and consequence of the aspect is apparent to observers.

LIVING POWER

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Starting at 3rd level, your powers become a living extension of your mind, weaving an extension of your will into reality, allowing you to manipulate your powers in more advanced ways. When you use a power or alternate effect of Psychokinetics, you can apply one of the following modifiers:
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Controlled Power

When you use a spell or power that targets an area, you can select a number of creatures equal to the psi points spent in the area of effect for the spell or power to be ignored. The power passes harmlessly around these creatures, they automatically succeed on their saving throw against the effect, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save against the effect.
### Layout: end frame

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Shaped Power

When you use a power or spell that makes a ranged spell attack, you can convert it to a melee spell attack (such as forming it into a weapon shape), and when you would make an attack that would make a melee spell attack, you can instead form it into a shape and hurl it at a target within 15 feet making a ranged spell attack.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Raging Power

When you use a spell or power, you can let it rage out of control. When you roll damage for the power or spell, you can reroll a number of dice up to 1 + the number of psi points spent. You must use the new roll.
### Layout: end frame

EMPOWERED PSIONICS

Starting at 6th level, when you deal damage with a psionic discipline power you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt.

FULL MANIFESTATION

Starting at 10th level, when you enter a primordial aspect, you can expend 1 psi point to fully manifest that element, replacing the primordial aspect with the following effect. If you are specialized in that element, it doesn’t require a psi point to fully manifest the power.

 • Cold. Your speed becomes 0 until the end of your next turn, but you have resistance to all damage types except fire and force.
 • Fire. Fire fills a 10-foot radius around you. When a creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it takes fire damage equal to 1d4 + your proficiency bonus.
 • Lightning. You can use your movement to teleport a distance up to your speed for the duration.

If you are not in a primordial aspect, you can fully manifest a power as a bonus action for 2 psi points (or 1 psi point if you are specialized in that power).

ELEMENTAL FORM

Starting at 14th level, you can expend 5 psi points to cast shapechange to assume elemental forms. When you cast shapechange in this way it has no verbal or material components, but you can only assume the form of a Water Elemental, Fire Elemental, or Air Elemental. If you are specialized in an element, the cost is reduced to 3 psi points, but you can only assume the form associated with your specialization (Water Elemental for cold, Fire Elemental for fire, or Air Elemental for lightning). A Water Elemental assumed with this form doesn’t have the Freeze property.

Once you cast shapechange this way, you can’t do so until you finish a short or long rest.

 • Psionic Archtype: Elemental Mind

CONSUMING MIND

A Consuming Mind is a master of a dangerous branch of psionics, born from the ability to sap energy from other creatures. This power can tear away thoughts, minds, and ultimately vitality for the psion’s own consumption. A feared branch of psionics, it is sometimes believed to be one of the primeval roots of all psionic power, as it can be found among mind-eating monsters and ancient psionic space whales... which might have other names in various settings.

It has been refined by those that seek greater power either from ambition or desperation, and unlocks a terrible but effective path. One example of mortal creatures walking this path are the houses of dark elves, who developed their dark powers from their study of feral, vampiric, brain-eating monsters.

PSIONIC PREDATOR

At 1st level when you select this archetype, you gain the ability to consume the psionic power of others. You gain the psionic discipline of Consumption.

DARK LURKER

Additionally at 1st level, your powers grant you intuition that allows you to better adapt and survive as a mind hunter. You gain proficiency in Stealth and Deception. If you are already proficient in either skill, you instead become proficient in a skill of your choice.

When you use psionic abilities, you can make an Intelligence (Deception) check contested by a target’s Wisdom (Insight) to conceal your use of psionic powers from them, suppressing the ability’s usual visible indicators. If you spend psi points on the ability, you must subtract the psi points spent from your Intelligence (Deception) roll result (concealing greater uses of psionics being more difficult).

RAVENOUS POWERS

Starting at 3rd level, you gain the Psionic Talent Mind Devourer; this talent ignores the normal level restriction, and doesn’t count against your Psionic Talents known, but can’t be switched out on leveling up.

Additionally, you can gain the benefit of this Talent from a range of 30 feet when the creature is killed by one of your psionic powers.

EMPOWERED PSIONICS

Starting at 6th level, when you deal damage with a psionic discipline power you can add your Intelligence modifier to the damage dealt.

MIND VAMPIRE

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Starting at 10th level, you can trigger Mind Devourer anytime you deal psychic damage to a target within 30 feet, whether it kills the target or not.

Further, you can have additional psi points (over your normal limit) equal to half your Intelligence modifier (rounded down) when gaining psi points from Mind Devourer, but any additional psi points are lost when you finish a short or long rest.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Limitations

Even when used with Mind Vampire, Mind Devourer still requires a reaction to use, meaning that it can still effectively trigger once per round. All normal restrictions of Mind Devourer still apply (such as a minimum Intelligence ability score of the target.)
### Layout: end frame

SHATTERED HUSKS

Starting at 14th level, your Mind Leech ability always gains the Shredding modifier, and it doesn’t cost a psi point to add the modifier.

Further, you can use additional power to leave their mind further vulnerable. You can spend additional psi points on the Shredding modifier to further reduce their next Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw (up to 2 additional points to reduce it by a total of 3d4). Once this effect has been applied to a creature, you can’t spend additional psi points on the Shredding modifier against the creature until 1 hour has passed.

Body Control (Prerequisite: 5th-level Psion) 
You can cast alter self at will, without expending a spell slot or psi points. Additionally, when you cast enlarge/reduce on yourself, you may expend 1 psi point instead of 2.

Enhanced Regrowth 
You gain the cure wounds spell, and can cast it as a 1st-level spell by expending 1 psi point. You can cast it at a higher level by spending an additional psi point for each level above first. When you cast cure wounds on a creature, you can use Enhancing Surge on that creature as a bonus action.

Metamorphosis (Prerequisite: Body Control) 
The mutate and polymorph spells are added to your Enhancement Alternate Effects list.

You can only target yourself when casting polymorph this way.

Physical Surge 
When you use Enhancing Surge targeting yourself, you can choose to make your Strength or Dexterity ability score equal to your Intelligence ability score until the start of your next turn.

Surging Power

The mass cure wounds and reincarnate spells are added to your Enhancement Alternate Effects list. Reincarnate requires its normal material components when cast this way.

 • Psionic Discipline: Enhancement

PROJECTION DISCIPLINE

Projection is the ability to project what is in your mind to the outside world with your psionic power.

PROJECT ITEM

As an action, you can use your powers to project an inanimate object you imagine into your hands. It can’t be larger than 3 feet on any side or weigh more than 10 pounds, and is clearly ethereal in nature. The item behaves as a solid object. Weapons created with this feature deal force damage.

Projected items fade after 1 minute, and you can have no more than 3 projected items at a time.

ASTRAL CONSTRUCT

Psionic Power

Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: 60 feet
 Components: S
 Duration: Concentration, up to 1 minute

You project an ethereal creation from your mind at a space you can see within range, taking the shape of a Medium or smaller creature, weapon, or other object. This creation is clearly ethereal in nature. When you create it, and on subsequent turns using your action to mentally control it, you can move it up to 30 feet in any direction and attack, so long as it doesn’t move beyond the range of the power. To attack with it, make a melee spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage. If the Astral Construct moves out of range of the spell, it fades away into nothing, ending the spell.

While the Astral Construct is active, you can spend psi points up to your per use limit to issue commands that affect and empower your construct. Commands require no action, but you can’t exceed your psi point limit in total commands issued, and each command can only be issued once per turn.

Grab (1 psi point): Can only be used while your construct is Solidified. A target creature within 5 feet of your construct that is no more than one size larger than the construct must make a Strength saving throw or become restrained by the construct. At the end of each of the restrained creature’s turns it can repeat the saving throw. The condition ends if the construct becomes ethereal again, or becomes more than one size smaller than the target.

Grow (1 psi point): Your construct increases by one size, and its number of damage dice increases by one. It returns to its normal size at the start of your next turn. It can only gain one additional die (for example, up to 2d8).

Relocate (1 psi point): The construct disappears and reappears anywhere within 60 feet of you.

Replicate (3 psi points): You use Relocate, but the original doesn’t disappear. Until the end of your turn, you have another construct and control both with the same action (commands only affect one of your choice). Pick one construct to fade at the start of your next turn or use Sustain.

Solidify (1 psi point): Your construct becomes solid, blocking its space until the start of your next turn. You can only use this command if it is in an unoccupied space. It has an armor class of 16 and hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier + your psion level. The construct becomes ethereal again if it drops to zero hit points.

Strike (2 psi points): The construct makes an attack (even if it has already attacked).

Sustain (1+ psi points): At the start of your turn, you can sustain the effect of a Solidify, Grow or Replicate command for an additional round. An effect that has been replicated can be sustained across all replicated constructs with a single use, but each effect can only be sustained once per turn (for example, you can never sustain more than one replicated construct). This costs 1 psi point for each effect sustained. Sustaining Solidify refreshes the construct’s hit points to its maximum.

ALTERNATE EFFECTS

Astral Swap 
As a bonus action, you can expend 1 psi point to swap places with your Astral Construct.

Life Link 
When a solidified construct takes damage, you can choose to take that damage instead of the construct (no action required). You have resistance to the damage taken.

Matter Made Real (Prerequisite: 9th-level Psion) 
You gain the ability to solidify some of your projections into real objects. You can cast fabricate and wall of stone by expending psi points equal to the spell level.

Projected Weaponry 
When you project a weapon with your Project Item feature, it gains the following benefits:

 • You can project it as a bonus action and you can project up 3 weapons or pieces of ammunition at the same time.
 • You are proficient with any projected weapon.
 • It is no longer restricted to a maximum of 3 feet when it takes the form of a weapon (for a Medium-sized creature).
 • You can use your Intelligence modifier in place of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for attack and damage rolls with it.
 • If it has the thrown property, its throwing range is doubled. If it doesn’t have the thrown property, it gains the thrown (10/30) property.
 • You can apply the Astral Construct modifiers Grow and Sustain to Projected Weaponry. Grow adds 1d8 to the weapon’s damage dice. You can expend Psionic Mastery on these modifiers.

Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 60 feet
 Components: S

You can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following modifiers to Telekinetic Force (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.

Crushing (2 psi points): The target is restrained until the end of its next turn if it fails its saving throw.

Hammering (1+ psi points): The target takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage for each point spent if it fails its saving throw.

TELEKINESIS TALENTS

The following talents can be selected if you have the Telekinesis Discipline:

Kinetic Slam 
When you use the Telekinetic Force power, you can unleash it as a blast of kinetic power. You can use your power as a ranged spell attack (applying damage and effects on hit) instead of requiring a Strength saving throw. You can only select the Hammering modifier when you use it in this way.

Mental Might (Prerequisite: 5th-level Psion) 
You learn to focus your mental grip. You can use your Intelligence modifier instead of other ability modifiers when you make an Athletics check.

Additionally, you may attempt to grapple or shove a creature within 30 feet, using your mind. When grappling a creature in this way, you can’t move them. Maintaining a grapple at a range greater than your natural reach requires concentration, as if concentrating on a spell, and the grapple ends if concentration is lost.

Precise Power (Prerequisite: 9th-level Psion; incompatible with Unchecked Power) 
The animate objects spell is added to your Telekinesis Alternate Effects list, which you can cast expending 5 psi points. Additionally, as a reaction to a ranged weapon attack you can see being made against a target within 60 feet of you, you can expend 1 psi point to add or subtract 2d4 to or from that attack roll. You can do this after the attack is rolled, but before you know the outcome of the roll.

Telekinetic Movement 
You can expend 1 psi point to gain 10 additional feet of movement and the effect of spider climb , feather fall , or levitate until the start of your next turn (no action required). At the start of your next turn, you can expend 1 psi point to maintain the effect before it would end.

Telekinetic Weapons 
You gain the Telekinetic Weapons psionic power as part of your Telekinetic Discipline (in addition to your other psionic powers), giving you the ability to fling weapons as per the power.

Telekinetic Barrier 
You focus your telekinetic power, spreading it thin to create a large barrier. As an action you can expend 2 psi points to create a wall of weak telekinetic force 15 feet high and up to 40 feet long, or as a 15 radius around you. This barrier is visible as small objects hover and float within it. If you create it around yourself, it moves with you when you move. Ranged attacks that pass through this barrier are made with disadvantage as their trajectory is deflected. You can maintain this barrier by concentrating, as if concentrating on a spell, for up to 1 minute after creating it.

Unchecked Power (Prerequisite: 9th-level Psion; incompatible with Precise Power) 
The fissure* spell is added to your Telekinesis Alternate Effects list. Additionally, as a reaction to a melee attack being made against you, you can expend 1 psi point to shove the creature away. The creature must make a Strength saving throw, or be knocked 10 feet backwards. If this puts the attack out of reach, the attack automatically misses.

 • Psionic Discipline: Telekinesis

TELEPATHY DISCIPLINE

Telepathy is the ability to interact with the minds of other creatures using your psionic abilities.

Meddling (2 psi points): You make one creature invisible to the target creature or cause the creature to see something that is not there with the effect of minor illusion until the start of your next turn if it fails its saving throw.

Overwhelming (3 psi points): The target is stunned until the end of its next turn if it fails its saving throw.

Rending (1+ psi points): The target takes 1d8 psychic damage for each additional point spent on a failed save.

If a spell can be cast at a higher level, you can spend additional psi points to cast it at a level equal to the psi points spent.

TELEPATHY TALENTS

Attuned Argument 
Your telepathic insight allows to adapt and tailor your influence on others. When you make a Charisma check, after you roll but before you know the outcome, you can choose to roll an additional d20 and take the higher result. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a long rest.

Empathy 
You can psionically link yourself to other creatures. As a reaction to a creature you can see within 120 feet of you taking damage, you can grant them resistance to the damage taken, but you take psychic damage equal to the damage they take (after resistance). The damage you take can’t be reduced or prevented in any way.

If the damage would inflict any further negative status effect on the target, you can choose for that effect to affect you instead.

If you have any form of telepathic bond that allows long-distance telepathic communication affecting the creature taking this damage, the range is unlimited and you do not need to be able to see them.

Mental Image 
You gain the ability to use your Telepathy to project images into the minds of creatures with perfect clarity, interposing it over their reality. The spells silent image , major image , hallucinatory terrain , and seeming are added to your Telepathic Discipline Alternate Effects list costing psi points equal to their spell level.

Mental Influence 
You specialize in the subtle touch, picking stray thoughts and soothing concerns without overtly intruding upon a mind. You gain expertise in the Persuasion skill, though you are reduced to normal proficiency against creatures that are immune to mental influence or charm (such a creature under the effect of mind blank ).

Reflected Agony 
When a creature within 120 feet that you can see deals damage to you, you can use your reaction to spend 1 or more psi points (up to your psi limit) to share the pain you experienced back at them, dealing 1d10 psychic damage per point spent. The damage this deals can’t exceed the damage taken from the attack.

Tactical Opening (Prerequisite: 5th-level Psion) 
You can communicate the openings in a creature’s defenses to your allies. When a creature fails a saving throw against your Telepathic Intrusion, you can take the Help action targeting that creature as a bonus action, helping another creature that you can telepathically communicate with. When you take the Help action in this way, the range of it becomes 30 feet.

Telepathic Link 
Your Telepathic Communication gains an unlimited range as long as you have communicated with the creature within the last day, and the target willingly maintains the link. However, it takes an action to focus to communicate over distance if you can’t see the target (or for the target to communicate with you if they can’t see you). You can maintain a link with a number of people equal to your Intelligence modifier in this way. You can convey as much in a turn as you could by speaking normally.

 • Psionic Discipline: Telepathy

TRANSPOSITION DISCIPLINE

Transposition is the ability to modify the properties of space and manipulate dimensional boundaries with your psionic powers.

FLICKER STEP

On your turn, you can replace your movement by teleporting 5 feet in any direction to a space you can see. You can pass through creatures but can’t pass through objects, buildings or terrain more than 4 inches thick. This distance increases by 5 feet at 5th level (to 10 feet), at 11th level (to 15 feet), and becomes equal to your speed at 17th level. This replaces all movement for your turn when used.

PHASE RIFT

Psionic Power

Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: Self
 Components: S
 Duration: 1 round

You step through space, traveling up to 10 feet in a straight line leaving a spatial tear behind. You can pass through creatures but can’t pass through objects, buildings or terrain more than 4 inches thick. Any creature in the path of this tear must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 force damage.

You can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following modifiers to Phase Rift (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.

Blurring (1–3 psi point): You gain an illusory duplicate, as per the mirror image spell. You gain 1 duplicate per psi point spent (up to a maximum of 3). One remaining image fades at the start of each of your turns.

Disruptive (1+ psi points): Each target that fails their saving throw takes an extra 1d8 force damage for each point spent.

Echoing (2 psi points): You immediately use Phase Rift again with the same action.

Ethereal (2 psi points): You can pass through solid objects, buildings, and terrain as long as you end your Phase Rift in a space you can occupy. If your Phase Rift would end inside a space you can’t occupy, the power fails.

Long (1–3 psi points): You can travel an additional 10 feet for each point spent.

TRANSPOSITION TALENTS

The following talents can be selected if you have the Transposition Discipline:

Rift Strike 
When you use your Phase Rift power as an action, you can make a single weapon attack as a bonus action.

Flickering Escape (Prerequisite: 11th-level Psion) 
Whenever you roll a d4 for flicker* , you can teleport 5 feet after the attack resolves.

Lingering Rifts 
When you use Phase Rift you can choose to leave a 5 foot wide tear in reality behind, forming a line between your starting location and ending location until the start of your next turn. Any creature that enters this area for the first time or ends their turn in it must make a saving throw against the effect of Phase Rift as if it passed through them. If a creature is in the area of multiple lingering rifts, they are affected only once.

Phase Shot (Prerequisite: Rift Strike) 
When use your Phase Rift power, you can instead empower a piece of ammunition you touch, granting it the following special properties when you fire it:

 • It can be fired through all cover, including total cover, that is less than 4 inches thick.
 • It deals 1d8 additional force damage.

Additionally, applying Phase Rift modifiers grant special effects on this attack:

 • Disruptive: The attack deals an extra 1d8 force damage on hit.
 • Blurring: You can roll an additional attack roll per psi point spent, selecting the highest roll.
 • Long: The effective range of the attack is increased by 10 feet per point spent.
 • Echoing: A second projectile is created on firing, using a separate attack roll. (You may target any creature in range with this attack, including the same creature)

Phase Slash (Prerequisite: Rift Strike, 11th-level Psion) 
You can expend 1 psi point to make a single melee weapon attack against any targets you pass through with Phase Rift as part of the same action. You must spend 1 psi point per creature attacked this way. You can make this attack against a target once per turn. You can spend Psionic Mastery points on this talent.

Phase Shroud 
After using Phase Rift, you gain temporary hit points equal to your proficiency bonus + the psi points spent on the power.

 • Psionic Discipline: Transposition

PSYCHOKINESIS DISCIPLINE

Psychokinesis is the mental art of spontaneously creating and controlling energy; sapping energy to freeze or spontaneously creating bursts of fire or arcs of lightning. Dangerous and destructive, it provides devastating power.

ENERGY MANIPULATION

When you gain this feature, you can manipulate energy in minor ways at will. As an action, you can cause a light that emits 30 feet of bright light and 30 feet of dim light, cause objects you touch to catch fire as if touched by a match, cause small arcs of electricity, or freeze or thaw up to 5-foot cube of water. Any ongoing effect you create lasts 1 minute. You can have a number of simultaneous effects active up your Intelligence modifier, after which creating another ends the oldest ongoing effect.

ELEMENTAL BLAST

Psionic Power

Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 30 feet
 Components: S
 Duration: 1 round

You can use your mind to create a burst of elemental power, blasting a target you can see within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold, fire, force or lightning damage.

For each die of cold damage dealt, the creature’s speed is reduced by 5 feet until the end of their next turn. For each die of fire damage dealt by the original attack, the creature takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of its next turn. For each die of lightning damage dealt, an arc of lightning strikes another creature of your choice within 20 feet, dealing 1d4 lightning damage (multiple arcs may strike the same creature). Damage from these secondary effects doesn’t add any bonuses (such as Empowered Psionics).

You can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following modifiers to (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.

Amplified (1+ psi points): The target takes an extra 1d8 cold, fire, force or lightning damage on a hit for each additional point spent.

Lasting (1 psi point): Your Elemental Blast leaves a 5-foot radius sphere of devastation behind where it strikes until the start of your next turn. Creatures that enter this zone for the first time or end their turn in it must make a Constitution saving throw or suffer the secondary effects (slow, burn, arc) of the blast as if they had been hit by it.

Massive (1–3 psi points): You unleash a massive blast; rather than making an attack roll, all creatures within a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity Saving throw. On failure, they take the effect as if hit by the Elemental Blast. The size of the cone is doubled for each point up to 3 spent (2 points for 30 feet, 3 points for 60 feet).

Overcharged (0 psi points): You take 1d4 force damage and do not add your proficiency bonus from the attack or spell save DC for your Elemental Blast, but increase the damage it deals by twice your proficiency bonus.

Cryokinetic

You can only deal cold damage with Elemental Blast. When a creature is hit by an attack of your Elemental Blast or fails a saving throw against this power, it becomes frozen until the end of its next turn, giving it disadvantage on its next attack roll or Dexterity saving throw, and reducing its speed by an additional 5 feet (to a total of 10 feet).

If the attack roll is a critical hit or the target fails their saving throw by 5 or more, the target becomes restrained while frozen.

PSYCHOKINESIS TALENTS

Elemental Aegis 
As an action, you surround yourself with a swirling shield of fire, ice, or lightning. You gain temporary hit points equal to your psion level + your Intelligence modifier. Creatures that strike you while you have these temporary hit points take 1d4 damage of the shield type chosen.

Once you use this talent, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

Elemental Emotions

Elemental Shield (Prerequisite: 9th-level Psion) 
You gain the ability to cast fire shield without expending psi points.

Once you cast it this way, you can’t cast it again until you finish a long rest, unless you spend 4 Psi Points to cast it again.

Manifested Emotions (Prerequisite: Elemental Emotions) 
You can manifest your emotions into elemental powers that take physical shape. While you are in an elemental emotion, you can expend 2 psi points to manifest that emotion into the world as a bonus action; this takes the form of a mephit (ice mephit for cold, magma mephit for fire, and dust mephit for lightning).

As your emotion, given form, it acts immediately after your initiative at your directive. If not destroyed, it lasts for up to 1 minute, after which it naturally fades away. You can’t manifest more than one emotion at a time, and if it is destroyed, you take 2d6 psychic damage from the backlash.

This manifestation is not a sentient creature of its own, but simply a manifestation of your emotion.

Emotional Actions 
There are no mechanical limitations on the actions of the manifested emotion, but it is recommended you consider the emotion from which it is manifest when determining its actions. Magma mephits will act rashly and aggressively, dust mephits will be restless and easily distracted, and ice mephits will be cold and calculating.

 • Psionic Discipline: Psychokinesis

PRECOGNITION DISCIPLINE

Precognition is the ability to see what lies ahead, piercing the veil of the future. Seeing things that most people cannot a Psion with Precognitive abilities can, to a limited extent, know the future; such a future is known by tracing its roots from the present, and grows more mysterious and cloudy as such roots grow distant.

Such a future can be changed by the actions of the present, particularly by knowledge of said future and action to prevent or change it. This is the function most often leveraged by Precognitive Psions, peering into the future to steer around courses they seek to prevent or steer toward a possible outcome they seek.

PRESCIENCE

Your eyes wander to events before they happen. You can add your proficiency to Perception and initiative rolls; if you already are able to add your proficiency to Perception, you can add twice your proficiency.

If you concentrate on keeping an eye on the future (as if concentrating on a spell), you can use your Intelligence modifier for Wisdom (Perception) checks (instead of Wisdom) and initiative rolls (instead of Dexterity), and you make Intelligence saving throws in place of Dexterity saving throws. You can initiate this concentration at any time.

SEEING

Psionic Power

Casting Time: 1 action 
Range: Self 
Components: S 
Duration: Instantaneous

You concentrate and peer into the stream of future possibilities, gaining insight into what will happen next; you can select one of the following:

 • You can grant advantage to yourself or to a creature that can see or hear you on their next attack roll made before the start of your next turn; if an attack that gained advantage from this feature hits, it deals an extra 1d6 damage.
 • You can grant disadvantage on the next attack roll against yourself or a creature that can see or hear you before the start of your next turn; if that attack hits despite the disadvantage, the damaged creature rolls 1d6 and subtracts that from the damage dealt.

You can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following modifiers to Seeing (you can add multiple modifiers).

Omniscient (1 psi point): The beneficiary of your Seeing is under the effect of bless and guidance until the start of your next turn.

Piercing (1+ psi points): You see through the target’s defenses when granting advantage, increasing the damage of the attack benefiting from advantage by 1d8 per psi point spent if it hits.

Positioning (1+ psi points): The beneficiary of your Seeing can immediately move 5 feet per psi point spent (up to their speed) without provoking opportunity attacks.

Thwarting (2 psi points): The beneficiary of your Seeing has advantage on the next saving throw they make before the start of your next turn.

Withheld (0 psi points): Rather than granting advantage or disadvantage on the next attack, you can grant advantage or disadvantage as a reaction to an attack being made until the start of your next turn.

ALTERNATE EFFECTS

Additionally, when you learn the Precognition psionic discipline you can use your Psionics feature to cast the following spells as per the rules defined in the feature:

If a spell can be cast at a higher level, you can spend additional psi points to cast it at a level equal to the psi points spent.

PRECOGNITION TALENTS

Glimpsed Future 
When you use Seeing with yourself as the beneficiary, you can use it as a bonus action. When you use Seeing as a bonus action in this way, it doesn’t grant additional damage to the attack, or reduce damage taken when hit.

One Step Ahead 
When you are subjected to a saving throw, you can expend 1 psi point and glimpse into the future. You know what the effect you are saving against is if it is a spell or psionic effect as if you passed an Intelligence (Arcana) or Intelligence (Psionics) check to identify it. Additionally you can add your Intelligence modifier to your saving throw against it regardless of its nature.

Precognitive Dreams (Prerequisite: 11th-level Psion) 
When you finish a long rest, your dreams have prepared you for the day to come. Upon waking, you issue reassuring words and advice to your companions to help them survive the day, giving them temporary hit points equal to your Intelligence modifier. During the next 24 hours, you can’t be surprised.

 • Psionic Discipline: Precognition

NULLIFICATION DISCIPLINE

Nullification is the ability to interfere with the supernatural effects of the world, reverting reality back to its original state.

DISRUPTIVE TOUCH

When you gain this feature, you can create an aura of interference, wreathing yourself in the disruptive power that asserts reality. You can end minor magical or psionic effects (such as the result of cantrips or zero point psionic powers) by touching them, and have resistance to illusions or magical damage from things you touch (gaining advantage on the saving throw against them, if applicable).

If you are grappling or otherwise touching a spellcasting or psionic creature, at the start of your turn you can expend 1 or more psi to interfere with their abilities until the start of your next turn. In order to cast a spell or use a psionic power, they must succeed on a saving throw of their spellcasting or psionic ability score against your psionics DC, unless they are casting a spell with a higher level or using a power with more psi points than the psi points spent on this feature.

DENIAL

Psionic Power

Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 30 feet
 Components: S
 Duration: Instantaneous

You release a burst of raw psionic nullification at a creature you can see within range. The creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On failure, it takes 1d4 force damage as its existence is disrupted.

If the target is an aberration, celestial, construct, elemental, fey, fiend, undead, or a creature with the ability to cast spells or use psionic powers, it takes an extra 1d4 force damage, and becomes disoriented; until the end of its next turn, it rolls a d4 and subtracts the number rolled from all its attack rolls and ability checks, as well as its Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration. A creature can choose to fail the saving throw.

You can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following modifiers to Denial modifying its functionality (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.

Aura of (3 psi points): Instead of targeting a creature, the power becomes an effect around you with a radius of 20 feet until the start of your next turn; any creature of your choice that enters or starts its turn in the area of effect must make a saving throw against the power.

Existential (1+ psi points): You deal an additional 1d4 initial and bonus (if applicable) force damage to the target creature on a failed save.

Firm (2 psi points): The target creature has disadvantage on the saving throw against this ability.

Lingering (1+ psi points): You can apply the effect of Disruptive Touch to an affected creature.

Supernatural (1+ psi points): A supernatural effect of or on the creature is ended; if the effect is a magical or psionic power, it is only ended if the psi points spent on this modifier equals or exceeds the spell level or psi points spent on the effect.

If the property is an innate property of a creature (either of the target creature, or affecting the target of this power), it is only ended if the psi points exceed the CR (or class levels) of the target creature, and they return at the end of that creature’s next turn. The supernatural effect can’t be its existence, unless it has less than 10 hit points and it would otherwise qualify.

ALTERNATE EFFECTS

Deadspot (Prerequisite: 15th-level Psion) 
You gain the ability to expend 8 psi points to cast antimagic field . Once you cast it this way, you can’t cast it again until you finish a long rest.

Iron Templar 
You gain proficiency with medium armor and shields. If you already have proficiency with medium armor, you gain proficiency with heavy armor. You can perform somatic components for psionic powers with a hand carrying a weapon.

Additionally, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack or with a spell attack with a range of touch, you can use your Denial power as a bonus action targeting that creature.

Magical Anathema 
You gain resistance to damage dealt by spells or magical effects. The effect of all magical healing effects (including healing potions) on you is halved.

Magical Resistance (Prerequisite: 9th-level Psion) 
You have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

 • Psionic Discipline: Nullification

PSIONIC TALENTS

Astral Arms 
As a bonus action, you can expend 1 psi point to create psionic constructions serving as additional appendages. These arms last for 10 minutes. You determine the arms’ appearance, and they vanish early if you are incapacitated or die. You can use the astral arms to make unarmed strikes. The unarmed strikes you make with the arms use your Intelligence modifier in place of your Strength modifier for the attack and damage rolls. If you hit with one of them, you deal force damage equal to 1d6 + your Intelligence modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

When you create them, or by spending 1 psi point as a bonus action while they are manifested, you can make a single unarmed strike with these arms as a bonus action. You can use Psionic Mastery points on this.

Aura Sight 
As an action, you can spend 1 psi point to psionically see the aura of a creature of your choice within 30 feet. When you see the creature’s aura in this way, you can determine if there are any spells or magical effects affecting the creature, and you learn their schools of magic, if any. You can also determine if the creature is under the influence of psionics. A shapeshifter or creature that is transformed or disguised by magical or nonmagical means must make a Charisma (Deception) check against your Psionics save DC. On a failure, you can perceive their original form in their aura.

Awaken Mind (Prerequisite: 9th-level Psion) 
You can cast awaken once without expending a spell slot or psi points.

You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Beam of Annihilation (Prerequisite: 11th-level Psion, Elemental Mind subclass) 
You gain the ability to cast a beam of annihilation* for 6 psi points. If you have a specialization of Psychokinesis, you can only select the related elemental damage type, but the beam’s damage ignores resistance to that damage type.

Controlled Power 
You gain the ability to suppress the glow and somatic component of your psionic powers. You can expend 2 psi points to use a power without a visual sign or somatic component. Each time you use this talent, the cost of doing so doubles until you finish a short or long rest.

Divided Mind (Prerequisite: 9th-level Psion) 
You learn the divide self* spell, and can cast it by expending 5 psi points. When you gain access to the Innate Psionics feature, you may expend a use of Innate Psionics to cast divide self* at the level of the use of Innate Psionics expended. For example, if you choose the teleport spell for your Innate Psionics feature at 13th level, you could expend a casting of teleport to instead cast divide self* as a 7th-level spell, and can’t cast teleport or divide self* as a 7th-level spell in this way until you finish a long rest.

You do not require the material components of the spell when you cast it by expending psi points or a use of Innate Psionics.

Dreamwalker (Prerequisite: 9th-level Psion) 
You gain the ability to cast dream . You can cast the spell without expending a spell slot, but once cast, you can’t cast it again until you finish a long rest.

Elemental Penetration (Prerequisite: Elemental Mind subclass) 
When you use a psionic power or spell that deals cold, fire, or lightning damage, you can expend 1 psi point to make the power ignore resistance to that elemental damage type.

If you have a specialization of Psychokinesis, if the target has immunity to the damage type chosen, this instead turns immunity into resistance for that power.

You can spend psi points granted by Psionic Mastery on this ability.

Empowered Strike (Prerequisite: Psychokinesis or Telekinetic Discipline) 
Once per turn, as part of making a weapon attack as part of the Attack action, you can empower a melee weapon you are holding with psionic power. When you hit a creature with a weapon, you can apply Elemental Blast or Telekinetic Force modifiers (you can only select a power you know) to the attack (you can use Psionic Mastery on this). This doesn’t deal the base damage of the power, but any added damage causes the additional effects of the power to occur.

When applying a modifier that would make it target an area of effect, only the target takes the weapon damage, but other creatures in the radius become a target of the attack as if using the power normally.

Life Wielder (Prerequisite: Enhancement or Consumption) 
You learn the spell invest life* . You can spend Psionic Mastery points to cast this spell.

Mind Devourer (Prerequisite: 5th-level Psion) 
You gain the ability to cast psychic drain* for 2 psi points. Additionally, whenever a creature within 10 feet of you with an Intelligence score of 6 or higher dies, you can expend your reaction to draw in its psionic power, regaining 1d4 hit points and 1 expended psi point.

Mind Rider 
As an action, you can touch a willing creature to see through its eyes and hear what it hears for the next hour, gaining the benefits of any special senses that the creature has.

During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. You can end this effect at any time. While this is active, the creature has advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.

Perfect Focus (Prerequisite: 10th-level Psion) 
You can enter a state of extreme focus. Your concentration is no longer interrupted by using a second ability that requires concentration, but your speed is reduced to 0 while concentrating on more than one effect; you have a -5 penalty to any Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration. If you move or fail a save to maintain concentration, one of the spells you are concentrating on ends. If you fail the saving throw to maintain concentration by 5 or more, you lose concentration on both spells.

Personal Truth 
Your power of conviction allows you to believe what you choose to. If you spend at least one minute convincing yourself of something—no matter how absurd—spells and effects to determine if you are telling the truth will register that you believe what you have convinced yourself of.

Additionally, your psionic powers allow you to impose your will upon reality to a certain extent. When you expend 1 psi point, you can perform a minor alteration to reality:

 • You can conjure any Tiny object you can imagine that is worth 1 sp or less. This creates an object as you envision it, but doesn’t grant you knowledge you do not otherwise have (for example, you would be unable to conjure a key to a lock unless you had a perfect mental image of the correct key).
 • As an action, you can change the color or taste of a Small or smaller object with 10 feet. This change lasts for 1 minute.
 • As a reaction to a creature within 30 feet taking damage (including yourself), you can change the damage type they take.

Potent Psionics 
When a target passes the saving throw against a damaging Psionic Power (granted by a psionic discipline), they still take half the damage, but suffer no other effects.

Psi Crystal 
You gain the ability to impart part of your mind into crystal. You can expend 2 psi points to cast the find familiar spell, but your familiar takes on the statics of a psi crystal (below) and the material component required is a crystal worth 10 gp instead of the normal material components. The Psi Crystal gains your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can use Psionic Disciplines with a range greater than self through your Psi Crystal as if you were standing in its location. If the psi crystal is destroyed, you gain its memories as your own. While you have a Psi Crystal active, as a bonus action, you can deactivate it to regain 2 expended psi points.

 • NPC: Psi Crystal

When you summon a Psi Crystal, you can store a fragment of your personality in it that you can then release by shattering the crystal. Select one of the following when summoning a psi crystal.

Courage. When you make a saving throw against the frightened condition, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion to gain advantage on the save.
 Cowardice. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 of you and a creature comes within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and immediately moving up to your speed away from the creature without taking any opportunity attacks.
 Cruelty. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 feet of a creature that takes damage, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and causing the creature to take additional damage equal to your psion level.
 Sympathy. When your Psi Crystal is within 30 feet of you and another creature, if that creature takes damage, you can use your reaction to shatter the crystal, releasing that emotion and granting the creature resistance to that damage. You take an equal amount of damage to the damage they take.

Psionic Defenses 
You gain a way to defend yourself using your psionic powers. While you are not wearing any armor or carrying a shield, your AC equals 13 + your Intelligence modifier.

Psionic Weapon 
As a bonus action, you can expend 1 psi point to imbue a weapon you are holding with psionic energy. For 1 minute, once per turn when you deal damage with that weapon, you can deal an extra 1d6 psychic damage.

At higher levels you can expend additional psi points to further enhance the Psionic Weapon; 2 points to enhance it to 2d6 at 5th level, 3 points to enhance it to 3d6 at 11th level, and 4 points to enhance it to 4d6 at 17th level.

Projected Nightmares (Prerequisite: Shaper’s Mind Subclass) 
You gain an additional option for Boundless Imagination to apply to your Astral Construct:

 • Horrifying Nightmare: Creatures of your choice that start their turn within 5 feet of your Astral Construct must make a Wisdom saving throw against your Psionics DC or become frightened of your Astral Construct until the start of their next turn. On a successful save, they are immune to the effect for the next 24 hours or until you summon a new Astral Construct.

Propelled Bound (Prerequisite: Telekinesis or Psychokinesis) 
When you move on your turn, you can expend movement, up to your speed, in single bounding leap, propelled by telekinetic power or psychokinetic force.

Schism (Prerequisite: 5th-level Psion) 
You can spend 1 psi point to temporarily divide your mind to do two things at once until the end of your turn. While dividing your mind, if you use your action on a psionic power or spell granted by a Psionic Discipline, you can use your bonus action to use a psionic power that would normally take an action. The two powers share your per use psi point limit between them.

Tantrum (Prerequisite: Unleashed Mind subclass) 
Your anger boils just beneath the surface. When you roll initiative, you can instantly increase your rampage die by one step (from a d4 to a d6, for example). Additionally, if you take damage while your rampage die is a d6 or lower, your rampage die increases by one step.

 • Feature: Psionic Talents

SPECIAL PSIONIC POWERS

TELEKINETIC WEAPONS

Psionic Power

Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 30 feet
 Components: S
 Duration: Instantaneous

You telekinetically fling a weapon at a creature or object. Choose a weapon within 15 feet that isn’t being worn or carried, or choose a weapon under your control. Make a ranged spell attack. On hit the target takes damage equal to the weapon’s damage dice. The range of the attack decreases to 15 feet if the weapon has the heavy or special property, and increases to 60 feet if the weapon has the light property.

You can use Psionic Mastery points on this power, and this power counts as a Discipline Power of the Telekinetic Discipline (for example, for the purpose of Empowered Psionics).

You can spend psi points up to your per use limit to add the following modifiers to Telekinetic Weapons (you can add multiple modifiers). The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.

Multiple (1+ psi points): For each additional psi point spent, you can fling an additional weapon, making a separate attack and damage roll for each weapon flung.

Whirling (2+ psi points): You can replace one throwing of a weapon with casting cloud of daggers . It is cast at a level equal to the psi points spent.

 • Psionic Power: Telekinetic Weapons

Flinging Magic Weapons

Strictly ruled-as-written, most magic weapon properties wouldn’t apply to Telekinetic Weapons, but personally I would grant a flung +1 weapon its +1 to attack and damage rolls. However, if you allow this, this should not be allowed to stack with any sort of focus or magic item that grants bonuses to spell attack rolls. Only one bonus should apply to a given roll.

Keep in mind that there’s not inherently a way to get your weapon back, though you may be able to with other Psion abilities (such as Telekinetic Hands), so flinging magic weapons may not be an ideal tactic for longer ranges.

CLASS TOOLBOX

The class toolbox is just what the title implies. It’s an expanded set of tools for Inventor and Psion that provide additional upgrades, talents, and more, as well as some tips and tricks to help you build your own content for the classes.

The class toolbox is devided into two sections. First is optional variant options—additional subclass upgrades that represent ideas folks love, but aren’t suitable for all games in terms of balance or complexity. Some of these include the 19th-level upgrade series for Inventor, while others are upgrades that have large permenant effects on the character. These are optional content; they should always be considered to be at the discretion of the GM.

The second section is my guidance on how to create your own additional content for the classes—guidelines that will help you think about making upgrades, talents, and more, and what sort of considerations they should take into account if you want to maintain a balanced game.

INVENTOR CONTENT

GENERIC UPGRADES

9th-Level Upgrades

Cross-Disciplinary Expertise
 You can select an upgrade that applies to your Cross Disciplinary Knowledge selection. This can be an upgrade that directly improves it, or that requires it, of 5th level or lower. An upgrade selected in this way that does not normally have a limit (such as selecting Healing Draught or Frostbloom Reaction) can be used a maximum number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.

Alternatively, you can directly upgrade the benefit gained from your Cross-Disciplinary Upgrade, giving it a +1 to its attack rolls or save DC (up to a maximum total bonus of +3).

Lateral Studies
 You can select an additional selection from Cross Disciplinary Knowledge.

GADGETSMITH UPGRADES

19th-Level Upgrades

Flash of Brilliance
 As an action, you can sacrifice any three of your or gadgets (upgrades from this subclass) or essential tools to create create a new gadget on the spot. This gadget can recreate any other gadget provided by upgrades of this class, or can cast any spell of 5th level or lower once without expending a spell slot. This gadget lasts 1 minute or until used (if it casts a spell).

Your original gadgets can be rebuilt as part of a short rest. You can’t use this ability again until you finish a short or long rest.

GOLEMSMITH UPGRADES

19th-Level Upgrades

Soul Puppet 
You bind your soul to your golem. Your consciousness is transferred to the golem, and you gain complete control of the golem, retaining both its action and your own, but you are only able to take any action the golem could take with its action.

Your golem’s mental stats are replaced by your mental stats, and your golem gains all of your spell slots, attunement slots, and class features. Your former body dies and can’t be resurrected, unless a wish or similar magic returns your soul to your body.

POTIONSMITH UPGRADES

19th-Level Upgrades

Replicated Legend 
Combining your mastery of reactions and alchemical infusions, you create an unstable replica of a very rare or legendary potion. You can create this potion as an action, which lasts 1 minute or until consumed, having the effect of the potion it replicates.

Once you do this, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

INFUSIONSMITH

5th-Level Upgrades

Wondrous Infusion 
You infuse a magical item with your magic, creating a wondrous item. This item is an imperfect creation powered by your own magical power rather than a magical essence, and loses its magical power if you lose this upgrade. You can reclaim your power from the item by switching out this upgrade, or in a process taking 8 hours (after which you can infuse a new item). You can create a non-consumable wondrous item of Common or Uncommon rarity that is worth 500 gp or less.

19th-Level Upgrades

Investiture of Soul 
You learn the spell animate objects . It does not count against your spells known, and if you already know animate objects, you can learn a new spell of 5th level or lower that does not count against your spells known.

When you cast animate objects, you can expend a Hit Die in addition to the spell slot. When you do so, the spell is invest with your soul, and no longer requires concentration.

When cast in this way, it lasts until you cast animate objects again, or until all the animated objects are destroyed.

Size Matters Not
 When you animate a weapon, you can animate the weapon of a Large-sized creature. You can only animate one Largesized weapon at a time. This weapon deals twice the damage dice of a weapon for a Medium-sized creature. The weapon is always considered to have the heavy property, regardless of weapon type.

THUNDERSMITH UPGRADES

19th-Level Upgrades

Lightning Saber (Prerequisite: Charged Blade) 
You generate enough energy with your charged blade to form the blade from pure scintillating lighting. Your weapon casts bright light in a color of your choice for 30 feet, and dim light for additional 30 feet.

If your target is wearing nonmagical armor or natural armor, your attacks treat their armor class as 10 + their Dexterity modifier; only magical effects can add additional AC to the target’s defenses.

Railgun (Prerequisite: Thunder Cannon) 
The range of your Thunder Cannon is doubled, and creatures can no longer gain cover from objects that are less than 2 feet thick. You Thunder Cannon attacks now pierce the target, and can attack a second target within range behind the first target, though Thundermonger damage can still only be applied once.

WARSMITH UPGRADES

5th-Level Upgrades

Armor Entombed (Warplate or Integrated Armor) 
If your armor is perfect, why would you ever need to remove it? Your armor is considered both Integrated Armor and Warplate, and you can select the base AC and properties of either armor set, and select armor with either prerequisite as a prerequisite (though you can’t select upgrades that are incompatible with either type).

Your creature type becomes construct. You are immune to disease, and you gain immunity to poison damage and the poisoned condition. You no longer need to eat, drink, or sleep, though you must remain inactive for a minimum of 4 hours during a long rest to allow your systems to recharge. You can absorb certain types of healing magic, allowing you to recover hit points from magical effects that do not otherwise affect constructs (such as the cure wounds spell).

19th-Level Upgrades

Hyperspace Arsenal (Prerequisite: Recall)
 You expand the pocket dimension to store multiple sets of Wargear, as well as up to 100 pounds of weapons or items. As a bonus action, you can conjure and equip any weapon or item stored in the pocket dimension. Additionally, you can swap out your attuned Wargear for another set of Wargear with this upgrade in the pocket dimension during this bonus action, as long as it also has this upgrade, instantly ending your attunement to the set you were wearing and attuning to the new set.

Once you swap your Wargear using this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

FLESHSMITH UPGRADES

19th-Level Upgrades

Coursing Vitality
 You mend with extraordinary speed. When you expend a Hit Die with Uncanny Vitality, you can expend more than one Hit Die (up to the number you have available).

If you have less than half your maximum Hit Dice, at the end of your turn, you regain a Hit Die.

CURSESMITH UPGRADES

19th-Level Upgrades

Soul Anchor
 You bend all of your knowledge of soul devouring artifacts to create the pinnacle of dark magic. You bind your soul to an item. When you die, your body and equipment crumble to ash, reforming after 1 hour within 5 feet of the item to which you bound your soul. Once you revive in this way, you can’t revive in this way again for 1d10 days.

After the first time you have revived, your creature type becomes undead (if it was not already). The item ceases to work if you have not slain a creature in the last 10 days. The item has 25 hit points and an AC of 10. When you bind your soul to it, the item gains immunity to all damage types beside one, to which it gains vulnerability. You select this damage type when you create it.

RUNESMITH UPGRADES

19th-Level Upgrades

Living Rune
 When you cast a concentration spell, you can mark a rune that maintains concentration on the spell. The rune be can marked on a willing creature, or into the air (in which case it can’t move). The rune can be targeted and has an AC of 10 and 10 hit points, with resistance to nonmagical damage. It lasts for the duration of the spell unless destroyed.

You can only have one Living Rune marked at a time.

RELICSMITH UPGRADES

19th-Level Upgrades

Consecrated Weapon
 You gain the ability to focus divine energy into a weapon. As a bonus action, you can touch a weapon, consecrating it. For 10 minutes, the weapon emits bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. It deals an extra 1d8 radiant damage on hit while under this effect. If the weapon houses your Divine Relic, the damage is instead increased by 2d8 radiant damage. While consecrated, the wielder of the weapon is under the effect of the spell protection from evil and good.

Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to, allowing you to use it again.

 • Feature: Optional Inventor Upgrades

SPECIAL INVENTOR WEAPONS

The following are a series of weapons specially created for the Inventor. These are not part of the class, and not balanced against the class power budget, but are rather standalone magic items that are uniquely tailored to Inventors...mostly Thundersmiths, being that they are focused so keenly on cannons.

ADRA'VARK

Weapon (hand cannon), rare (requires attunement)

A single piece of worked stone, it has twisting alien runes worked across the length. When fired, this Hand Cannon fires bolts of pure force energy and doesn’t consume ammunition, and lacks the loud property.

Any Thundermonger damage applied by this weapon becomes force damage. When applying Thundermonger damage to undead, the dice become d8s.

ARM CANNON

Weapon (thunder cannon), common
 Can only be used by a character missing an arm.

One might hope to see this mostly on Warforged characters, but the world is a broad place. This weapon serves as a Thunder Cannon, but loses the two-handed property. The arm that this takes the place of can’t be used for anything besides holding and firing the thunder cannon or activating its upgrades.

EVOLVING MULTIWEAPON

Weapon, uncommon/rare/very rare/legendary (requires attunement)

This is a special weapon that leverages an Inventor’s mastery of creation to craft an evolving weapon that represents their developing skill. This weapon can only be created by an Inventor, and only the Inventor that creates it has proficiency in this weapon.

When you create this item, you select any two simple weapons. As a bonus action, you can convert the weapon between the two simple weapons. As your mastery of invention grows, you can evolve the weapon further.

As you progress in the Inventor class, you can evolve this weapon further, selecting from the following properties at the following levels:

XXXXXXX
Level	Property
5th	The weapon gains a +1 to attack and damage rolls.
7th	The weapon gains an additional simple weapon type to which it can transform.
9th	The weapon gains an additional simple or martial weapon it can transform to.
11th	The weapon adds +1d6 elemental damage to attack rolls. Select from acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder when you select this upgrade.
13th	The weapon adds a +2 to attack and damage rolls.
15th	The weapon gains an additional simple or martial weapon to which it can transform.
17th	The weapon adds +3 to attack and damage rolls.
20th	The weapon gains an additional simple or martial weapon to which it can transform., and adds a +4 to attack and damage rolls. As an action, you can change the elemental damage type of the weapon to another option of the 11th-level feature

ROLLING THUNDER

Weapon (thunder cannon), rare (requires attunement by an Inventor)

A lesser mind might look at this weapon and be led to believe that it is just five Thunder Cannons strapped together in a terrifying swirl of lunacy, but a true connoisseur can see that it is just awesomely five Thunder Cannons strapped together in an awesome swirl of brilliance.

This Thunder Cannon weighs 75 pounds and has the Heavy property.

When you fire this weapon with the Attack action, you can choose to fire up to five times, rolling a d20 for each attack roll at the same time. For each attack roll made, subtract 2 from the value rolled for all attack rolls. For example, when firing once this weapon takes a −2 penalty to its attack roll, when firing five times, it takes a −10 penalty to its attack rolls.

STORM HERALD

Weapon (thunder cannon), rare (requires attunement)

A massive, elegantly wrought cannon, it has many fine gears and sliding plates. In its compact mode, it functions as a Thunder Cannon. This weapon can add +1 to its attack and damage rolls.

As an action, you can deploy it into its "Herald" configuration, greatly extending the length of the weapon. While it is extended, the weapons range becomes 300/900 and your speed is halved, and any attack roll you make after moving on your turn is made with disadvantage.

You can collapse it back to its compact mode as a bonus action.

THUNDER SHOTGUN

Weapon (thunder cannon), uncommon (requires attunement)

A special cannon made to devastate at close range. This weapon has a range of 30/90, but doesn’t suffer disadvantage when there is a creature within melee range of you. It deals 4d4 damage to targets within 10 feet, 3d4 damage to targets within 20 feet, 2d4 damage to targets within 30 feet, and 1d4 damage to targets beyond 30 feet. This weapon has advantage on targets within 10 feet of you so long as there is nothing between you and the target.

This weapon must be reloaded with your bonus action once fired, and has disadvantage on all attacks if you have a Strength of 12 or less.

PSION CONTENT

Like Inventor, Psion is nearly infinitely expandable. It can be expanded in Disciplines, Talents, Spells, and Feats. The toolbox will go over the creation rules of each of those in the next section, but as with the Inventor, this section will provide an example—something that is both content that can be used, and vehicle for discussing how extensions to the system work and what the considerations are.

PSIONIC SYNTHESIS

One of the ideas of psionics that has been presented several times through the iterations of the class, is the idea of seamlessly melding two Disciplines to create new effects. synthesized abilties. There are a few things that have to be considered here.

THE ENTRY POINT

The first question is, “How does this system unlock?” There are three obvious routes: this can be a new functionality to the system without any investment, this can be a new talent, or this can be a feat.

Each presents a different budget for what this feature can do. If a feature doesn’t have any cost to unlock, it consequently shouldn’t have any added power. The trouble here is that new options almost inherently have added power, because flexibility is power. When there’s no investment into the system, you have no budget to work with, and consequently I wouldn’t recommend this route unless balance is not a strong consideration.

A talent and feat both provide a barrier to entry—and a very similar one, but with some notable differences. A feat can grant a talent, and only grants one talent when it does, so they are very similar in power. The difference comes in opportunity cost and accessibility. A talent can be taken with little opportunity cost to the character, while a feat is much harder to take in most cases, and will consequently raise the level of Inventor investment needed to unlock these options.

Generally, attaching an option to a feat will make fewer people engage with the system. However, this can make it a more unique decision point for the character, one that is entered with greater intentionality.

We’ll make Psionic Synthesis a feat for this reason. It results in inherently more complicated characters, and consequently it is not a system I want characters to stumble into. It represents another level of mastery and understanding of the system; not one that makes you better or stronger than characters that don’t use it, but one that allows you to explore new concepts within the system

PSIONIC SYNTHESIS

Prerequisite: 4th-level Psion, 2 or more psionic disciplines known

You gain the ability to meld your Psionic abilities together to produce potent new effects. When you select this feat, you can select one fusion talent for free. You can only select fusion talents when you have all the Disciplines in their prerequisite.

FUSION TALENTS

Here are some ideas for fusion talents that you might make available to a character. The power budget here is similar to what a feat would grant (since they had to take Psionic Synthesis to get access). More importantly, they try to provide a good answer for "If a character has both these disciplines, what are they trying to do?"

Astral Rift (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Transposition Discipline, Projection Discipline, Astral Swap Talent) 
As a bonus action, you can Phase Rift to where your Astral Construct is; this movement counts as a Phase Rift, and you can apply modifiers to it as normal. Your Astral Construct is moved to where you started this movement along the Phase Rift; during the movement you can command your Astral Construct to attack a creature it passes with its action.

Elemental Phasing (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Psychokinetics Discipline, Transposition Discipline) 
As you step between planes, you can tap into the Elemental Planes, bringing their power into the material with you. You can use Psychokinetic modifiers on Phase Rift (excluding Massive).

Additionally, whenever you deal damage to an area with a Psychokinetics ability that would include yourself, you can phase yourself out of reality to take no damage from the effect.

Kinetic Mastery (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Psychokinetics Discipline, Telekinesis Discipline) 
Your ability to manipulate energy becomes a single blended prowess, freely swapping between manipulating force and energy. You can apply Telekinetic Force modifiers to Kinetic Blast and Elemental Blast modifiers to Telekinetic Force (though to do not gain any benefits from from a Specialization while doing so).

Parasitic Nightmare (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Consumption Discipline, Telepathy Discipline) 
You gain the ability to add Telepathic Intrusion modifiers to Mind Leech.

Additionally, when you deal psychic damage to a creature that is frightened of you, you can render yourself invisible to that creature until the start of your next turn; you can immediately (no action required) roll an Intelligence (Stealth) check affecting only creatures you are invisible from as a result of this talent.

If you are hidden from a creature that is frightened of you, when it moves, you can use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of that creature (at the completion of their movement).

Phantom Blade Barrage (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Projected Weaponry, Telekinetic Weapons) 
You can create a weapon with Projected Weapon as part of making an attack with it using Telekinetic Weapons, allowing you to project as many weapons in this manner as you make attacks (no additional action required). When you use weapons created by Projected Weaponry as the projectiles for your Telekinetic Weapons, the range you can fling the weapons is doubled.

Additionally, if you expend 6 psi points on the Whirling modifier of Telekinetic Weapons, you can cast blade barrier instead of cloud of daggers , generating a much larger number of ethereal blades as part of the casting.

Physical Telekinesis (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Enhancement Discipline, Telekinesis Discipline) 
When you use an Enhancing Surge to empower a creature, you can expend a psi point to augment it with your Telekinesis to further assist them, optionally granting one of the following benefits:

 • You can move the creature 10 feet (this movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks).
 • You can telekinetically deflect the first weapon attack against them before the start of your next turn, giving that attack disadvantage.
 • You can telekinetically boost their next Strength (Athletics) check or weapon attack before the start of your next turn, granting that check or attack advantage.

Addititionally, while under the effect of Enhancing Surge, the amount you can lift, drag, or carry is doubled with assistance of your telekinesis, and you can apply Telekinetic Force modifiers to your weapon attacks.

Reality Warper (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Matter Made Real, Mental Image)
 You can bring the illusions you make people see to life. When you are concentrating on an illusion spell, as a bonus action you can expend psi points during your turn to bring aspects of the illusion into reality. For each psi point spent you can bring a 5-foot-cube section of the illusion into reality until the start of your next turn, and it can have the following effects:

 • If the effect would do damage, each 5-foot cube can damage one target. That target must pass a Dexterity saving throw, or take damage equal to a number of d8 dice equal to the level of the spell.
 • If the effect would stop a creature, they can’t move through it. If the effect would restrain a creature, that creature must pass a Dexterity saving throw or become restrained until the start of your next turn.
 • Each 5-foot cube can affect only one creature that is either within it or adjacent to it. The GM may allow other effects at their discretion.

The Void (Prerequisite: Psionic Synthesis, Consumption Discipline, Nullification Discipline) 
You devour all supernatural effects near you. Whenever a creature (including yourself) within 5 feet of you takes damage from a magical source, you can expend 1 or more psi points to use your reaction to reduce the damage taken by 1d8 per psi point spent. You can divide this amount between multiple creatures within range if they take damage at the same time.

Additionally, whenever you successfully cast counterspell , dispel magic , or remove curse , you regain hit points equal to the level of spell stopped or ended.

 • Feat: Psionic Synthesis (& Fusion Talents)

REFLAVORING CONTENT

Before we start building brand-new content, there’s another option to consider first: reflavoring content. This involves reskinning a feature, keeping its mechanics the same while changing the description to better fit your fiction. It provides an easier alternative: if all you’re changing is flavor and theme, you don’t have to worry about testing for balance nearly as much.

This isn’t always possible—after all, this whole book exists because new options do extend the kinds of characters you can play. But it is always worth considering, and so I’ll walk through an example of a popular reflavored option during testing... the "Dragonsmith". This isn’t necessarily offered as a unique option for play, but to show how something can be built from reflavored elements to achieve a unique outcome.

THE "DRAGONSMITH"

Playing some form of dragon-inspired content is always popular, and this could be a candidate for some custom upgrades, but I’ve accomplished this by using upgrades largely already present. Let’s walk through how I’d build a Dragonsmith out of an inventor.

First of all, we want to be as tanky as possible, and most of our upgrades are going to be about biting, breathing, or doing general dragon things.

We’ll start with Fleshsmith. While it tends to be somewhat on the horrifying end in its default flavor, let’s look at what we can get from it, based on what we need.

 • A dragon must breathe fire. We can accomplish this with Brimstone Bladder , giving us a fairly serviceable dragon breath.
 • A dragon should bite and/or claw things. We have our choice here, but Extra Fangs is a good option for ensuring our chompers will be online. We can always pick up Extra Claws later.
 • We’d like some natural armor , though we can make do with regular armor. Subdermal Plating reflavored to scales can fit the bill.
 • We want some elemental damage on that bite. Fleshcrafted Enhancement with the Infernal Modifier on our Extra Fangs gives us just the fire damage we are looking for.

We are only missing one iconic things: Wings. I would generally never recommend flight as a custom upgrade before level 11, and fortunately as level 11 rolls around, we can grab Wings Seem Useful to give us the dragon wings we were missing. Optional upgrades include Better Eyes to give you that draconic blindsight, the aforementioned Subdermal Plating, and we can give kick it up a notch with Massive Mutation giving us a "Dragonform"... it even has a built in "Frightful Presence"!

This is absolutely not a bid to say you don’t need custom upgrades. This just shows an example of how you can adapt what is already there for the basis of your build. The class is highly modular, and consequently reflavoring can get you much further than it might with less modular content.

BUILDING CUSTOM CONTENT

Invariably no matter how many options are presented, the first thing people will want to do is make more. This is fine, and expected. I cannot give you a bulletproof way to make new content because it is an equation with infinite variables, but what this section will do is arm you with the best tools and advice I have for your endeavor in this effort!

UPGRADES

To speak generically about upgrades is challenging, but I can give some broad strokes of advice.

 • The easiest way to make a new upgrade is to look at another upgrade that does similar things, and adapt the logic and limitations of that upgrade to the new one you want to make. There’s one important caveat: if your upgrade provides a stacking bonus, make it mutually exclusive with other upgrades it might stack with.
 • As a rule of thumb, if it grants a 1st- or 2nd-level spell, the upgrade can grant a free use per short rest if that’s all the upgrade grants. The exception is spells of exceptional power that should be limited or avoided... the classic example of this being the shield spell. I generally do not recommend giving an upgrade that grants the shield spell.
 • Spells that grant 3rd-level spells or higher should never grant the spell at a level earlier than a full caster would get the spell. If the spell only grants a single spell, that can be granted at the level a full caster would get it, as a single use per long rest.
 • Upgrades that grant additional spell lists can grant a single use of its 1st-level spell, and scale to a single use of a 2nd-level spell at 5th level. They should not grant more than one spell per spell level.
 • Upgrades that grant static bonuses to rolls or armor class should be carefully considered. These can define builds, and should only play to the strengths of the subclass in a build-defining way.
 • Upgrades that do not grant damage or defenses typically have more freedom to be powerful. You can be generous with movement, particularly if it doesn’t ignore opportunity attacks, but you can reference the existing movement speed and movement upgrades for reference (Accelerated Movement, Grappling Hook, and Boots of Striding as some examples).
 • And finally for the Grand Secret . The key to balancing options is opportunity cost . Consider what they give up to take this upgrade, and if those things are of roughly equal value. An upgrade can only be made stronger by having a higher opportunity cost that is relevant to that character. Giving up heavy armor, for example, is not an opportunity cost to a Dexterity-based character, but giving up a flat amount of AC would be.

Keeping those general guidelines in mind covers a surprisingly high number of the use cases. The game has infinite possibilities, but those possibilities generally fall into the categories above.

TALENTS

A lot of the guidance for upgrades is relevant to talents. If you skipped that section to get here, I’d recommend going back for it! But they do have some differences. The first and most important difference is that the budget for talents is lower than the budget for upgrades, and this has to be kept in mind. Talents also can be swapped out as you level for higher-level talents, so you cannot safely make new versions of high-level talents without removing existing ones (that are relevant to the character) from the pool of options.

Here’s a list of the advice in broad strokes:

 • Talents should, by and large, not deal additional damage. They can give additional ways to deal damage, but should rarely increase the damage of things you are already doing, unless they are taking the place of a talent that deals damage, and are exclusive with it. If a character taking your talent is adding damage without removing it elsewhere, you should exercise caution.
 • Talents that break the rule above or otherwise provide a potent effect should take a bonus action to activate. The Psion has many potent bonus action uses, and this limitation can serve as a good opportunity cost to gate the combination of features.
 • Talents should generally not grant free uses of combat relevant spells, and if they do, should recharge on a long rest.
 • Talents that grant spells should either grant no more than two spells, or grant a thematic list of mixed combat value.
 • Psion is a short rest caster. Any effects that last more than 1 hour should be tightly curtailed or limited per long rest. For example, a talent should not grant the animate dead spell without limiting it to 1/long rest, and generally any healing effects should be similarly limited, if they go beyond the strength of cure wounds.

These general guidelines cover most of the instances I can think of... and hopefully cover most of the instances you’ll think of, but there’s always room for more. Keeping these guidelines in mind, in particular the first one, will usually keep you fairly safe.

The three limitations of Psions are short rest resources, bonus actions being tied to most of the potent effects, and, of course, limited talent selection. Keep these in mind and you should be fine to expand the tapestry into infinite possibility.

DISCIPLINES

This is where things get a bit more meaty, and is something I would recommend with caution. If you are creating a new Disicipline, you are engaging in a major undertaking, and taking balance into your own hands.

But I’m happy to steer you the best you can, and consequently, I’ll give you the best advice I got in this endeavor, so you’ll at least be able to proceed with that!

 • All Disciplines are constructed in three parts: a minor passive feature that serves the function of a utility cantrip, a psionic power that serves the role of a flexible damage cantrip (with a list of modifications for spending psi points), and an alternate spell list. All three of these are balanced together.
 • The utility portion of the discipline should be more powerful and flexible than a typical utility cantrip. It often requires no action or replicates the effect of multiple cantrps, but as a rule, it should not deal damage, and should be tightly constrained to the concept of the discipline.
 • The psionic power of the discipline is the bulk of its power, and should be the thing you have in mind when setting out to make a Discipline. It should always take an action. If it deals damage, it should deal 1d8 or 1d10, and have a secondary effect, called a "rider effect". This can vary greatly, but if it deals damage it shouldn’t exceed a total damage of 1d12 without further investment. The rider effect should be consistently useful, but tied to the thing the power is doing.
 • The list of modifications should be phrased in such a way as to construct the name of the power, generally as prefixes to the power (for example the modifier "massive", building to "massive elemental blast").
 • There should be one option that scales the damage, such that if all psionic mastery points were used on that modifier, the damage of the power would scale the same way as a cantrip (i.e. 1d8 at level 1, 2d8 at level 5, etc).
 • Modifiers should be more expensive than a spell that costs the same number of points. Remember that (a) psionic mastery points can reduce the cost of these, and (b) that these are more action economy efficient than a spell, as you are still getting the basic effect of the power on top of the modifier effect.
 • Crowd control effects should cost as much as a spell that does that thing, but should not last more than 1 round, and should be used with some caution. For example, setting the cost of an ability that paralyzed at 2 points would be far too strong, despite the existence of hold person , even if the affect only lasted one round. An effect that paralyzed should cost 4–5 points, and be prohibitively expensive.
 • If the power targets weak saves (Strength, Intelligence, Charisma) its effects should be considered carefully. Powers uniquely can target weak saves, but that should be accounted for as part of the power budget.
 • The alternate spell list should include a mix of good spells and weak spells, but should generally not include shield.
 • If the power is exceptionally useful, the alternate effects should focus more on utility spells if possible.

Hopefully this can serve as a basis on your journey for making a new discipline. It is a complicated endeavor, but taking it one step at a time, and comparing it to existing disciplines can get you pretty far.

Adding Inventors to your setting might be a large change... or it might be no change at all. Inventors and their inventions can be the herald of a new method of scientific and systematic thinking about magic into more organized and useful structures—the forebearers of a magi-tech revolution... or they might simply be an eccentric wizard with strange methods others find completely unreproducible.

While Inventors are fully at home in any number of settings that end in the word "punk", they can also fit into almost any classical fantasy setting, simply with the assumption that their creations are ultimately fueled by their own power.

All of which is to say that the impact of inventors in your setting comes down to the reproducible nature of their creations, and the default assumption is that their class features are not reproducible at all.

What is more likely to have wide implications for a setting are the ways of thought of an Inventor, and this can make an interesting element or plot. What would the powers that be think of magical street lamps? Are magical streetlamps already widespread in your setting? Inventors are sometimes called an aspect of a "wide magic" (as opposed to a "high magic" vs. "low magic") dichotomy. They don’t bring higher magic to the table than a Wizard, but they are tied to the idea of "useable" magic.

Here are some considerations a GM and Inventor can consider:

 • Are Inventors a recognized profession? Are they unique or rare, or is the setting in full swing of tinkering with the laws of nature through magic technology?
 • Are their goals focused purely on creating their own tools and maximizing their ability as an adventurer, or are they trying to create reproducible effects? This can often tie into the crafting system.
 • What do the systems of power in your setting (kingdoms, guilds, gods) think of invention? Is there a force that maintains the status quo?
 • Are their inventions the cutting edge of the setting? Are there guilds competing for who can make the biggest, baddest, thunder cannon?

Inventors are not inherently different or disruptive—at the end of day they are just adventurers doing adventurer stuff. But they play to many themes that can have setting wide implications if that’s the route you want to go down.

In many fantasy settings, there is the implication that there is a "grand age of magic" in history where magic items and things were made. An Inventor with these abilities may be someone that is delving into the ancient past, an inheritor of what once was. They might be the reason that assumption isn’t true in your setting. They might be why your setting is in a great age of magic right now, building airships powered by crystals or elementals or fiendishly complicated metal contraptions.

As with many things, the best (and only) course of action is for the player and GM to discuss and align their expectations. It’s the GM’s world, and they may have put a lot of work into it! Consider what works best for the world, and what themes you want to play towards. An Inventor in your party can be a plot point... but it doesn’t have to be.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Psionics in your setting can be whatever you want them to be. They can be the same force as magic, or they can be something entirely different. Here’s what I generally assume them to be:

 • Psionics are supernatural powers that operate on the same mechanism and principles of magic, but is a different way to tap into and frame that power.
 • Psions draw their power from raw mental rigor that comes in different forms based on their subclass. It is a power that can be taught, but may rely on some underlying talent. While most similar to the powers of a Wizard, their structures of magic are internal, mental disciplines that are forged into their mind.
 • In my setting, the power behind ki and psionics is the same. They are powers of focus and mental discipline that manipulate the supernatural weave of the world.
 • They can be any of these in your setting, or none of these. The simplest and least impactful way to add psionics to a setting is to simply call it another way to use magic, and the system presented here supports that approach, but it also supports the extreme other end, while tending to assume something in the middle.

Here are some considerations for how you might treat it, as well as how I answer these questions in my settings:

Do Psionics work in areas that magic does not? Dead spots, antimagic zones, etc? 
For my setting, they do not. It is far simpler to just transpose all the rules of magic onto psionics. The base game does not assume the existence of player-psionics, and consequently features like "magic resistance" do not mention psionics. If you would like psionics to be a completely different power, you can certainly allow them to not interact directly with magic, but it will require more work, as you’ll need to decide which creatures should have unique resistance to psionics, etc.

Are Psionics widely recognized? Do people understand what they are? 
This same question can be posed to magic in a setting. In my setting, magic is widely recognized, and most people understand it. Psionics are far more rare and considered aberrant abilities, but scholars, adventurers, and the well informed will recognize them... often with some wariness or superstition. Folks with an understanding of magic may treat psionics the same way mundane folks might treat those that use magic—with fascination and distrust.

Is the Psion player character an anomaly? Is this a new outbreak of new powers that heralds the shifting of something beyond the material, or are they part of an ancient tradition? What is their place in the setting? 
These are all really the same question. A psion in a setting can be the introduction of psionics, or they can be an odd curiosity, a unique magic user whose abilities work with a subtle difference.

In my setting, psionics are an ancient power that predates the current systems of magic, introduced to mortal populations by interactions with ancient eldritch powers. These powers can be taught from preserved ancient traditions, or burst forth wildly from some new brush with the unknown. They are rare, but the level of rare to generate gossip, rumor, and curiosity. As with all things, set expectations with your player if their choices will draw them special attention.

Chapter 2: Subclasses

PATH OF THE RAGING MIND

The Path of the Raging Mind is a Barbarian that expresses their fury as a telekinetic manifestation. Their mind is so powerful that in their rage they warp the world around them. This is a psionic manifestation of a barbarian’s ability to focus their fury, and in battle this fury is weaponized as a deadly force that can fling about weapons and enemies alike.

They have to struggle with control... until they unleash themselves upon the battlefield, wreaking havoc on all that stands in their way.

Mental Strength

This subclass often represents strength of mind, rather than raw brawn, but does not use Intelligence. This is because applications of your mental strength are generally via telekinesis, not academic application, and Strength continues to better mechanically represent how it functions. Consider if your character’s physical strength is more of a representation of their telekinetic abilities when using their Strength ability score.

Even prior to taking this path, perhaps the character’s strength came from the instinctive use of their telekinesis at short range, only learning to manifest it beyond the range of their touch as they take this path.

If you would like to play this as an Intelligence class, replacing all references to Strength with Intelligence, it doesn’t really break anything. Consult your GM.

TELEKINETIC FURY

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, when you enter a rage, you can telekinetically project your rage onto the world around you. All melee weapons gain a thrown 30/60 property for you. This range is reduced to 15/45 if the weapon has the heavy property and increased to 60/120 if the weapon has the light property.

You can apply your Rage bonus damage to damage rolls made by thrown weapons, and can gain advantage from Reckless Attack on attacks made with thrown weapons.

At the start of your turn while you are raging, you can call a number of weapons or Tiny objects equal to your proficiency bonus within 60 feet to you, as long as they are not being worn or carried. You call these to your hands or to telekinetically orbit around you until the end of your turn (after which they fall to the ground). Weapons telekinetically orbiting you can only be used when throwing that weapon. At the end of your turn (or if your rage ends) all orbiting weapons drop to the ground around you.

DISTANT GRASP

Additionally at 3rd level, you can manipulate small objects within 30 feet with your mind as if using your hand to interact with them, though you have disadvantage on any checks relating to Dexterity when doing so. You can use this power to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can’t Attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds in this manner. You can move an item you are controlling in this way up to 30 feet during your turn.

While raging, the amount of pounds you can lift with this ability increases to 20 times your Barbarian level.

FORCEFUL MIND

Starting at 6th level, you gain the ability to use the psionic power Telekinetic Force. The DC for your Telekinetic Force is 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. When you take the attack action, you can use Telekinetic Force in place of one attack. While you are raging, you can add your Strength modifier and Rage bonus damage to damage done with Telekinetic Force.

TELEKINETIC FORCE

Psionic power

Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 60 feet
 Components: S
 Duration: Instantaneous

You smash a target creature or object you can see with your mental power. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw, or take 1d10 bludgeoning damage and be shoved 5 feet in a direction of your choosing or be knocked prone.

INTERFERENCE FIELD

Additionally at 6th level, while you are raging, you and all allied creatures within 10 feet of you are considered to have half cover against ranged weapon attacks, as your telekinetic powers distort the area around you.

COLLATERAL DAMAGE

Starting at 10th level, when you use Reckless Attack with a thrown weapon, you can ricochet to try and hit a second target within 5 feet of the first. Use the lower of the two dice you rolled for the Reckless Attack as the attack roll against the second creature. If disadvantage would cancel out the advantage from Reckless Attack, you may not use this feature.

FLING FOES

Starting at 14th level, you become the epicenter of the battlefield, flinging targets about. When you hit a target with a weapon while raging, you may choose to knock them 5 feet directly away from you on hit. When you use Telekinetic Force while raging, you can always choose to apply the Hurling modifier (as if using 2 psi points), shoving the target an additional 20 feet in a direction of your choice.

Additionally, all Medium and smaller objects and creatures that you are holding become improvised weapons for you, dealing 1d6 bludgeoning damage, with the thrown 20/60 property. To throw an unwilling creature, you must have it grappled, and you can’t throw it beyond its normal range.

Whenever you shove or throw a creature into another creature, both creatures take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

 • Barbarian: Path of the Raging Mind

PATH OF THE EXOSUIT

A truly unique Path, this is often defined by its exact nature, but such a nature varies widely. Perhaps it is a lost piece of technology, such as long dead Warsmith’s cast off armor that has developed strange properties, or perhaps it is an alien symbiote of some kind, with its own goal or objective (perhaps as simple as harmlessly feeding off your rage or your foes).

You can select one of the options from the table below or work with your GM to make an entirely new concept. It can be biological or mechanical in nature, or could even be part of your race or origin. Perhaps it is something you find or something you make, but whatever its origin, it grants you terrifying capabilities on the battlefield.

Invention or Artifact?

In general, this path represents a character coming into contact with a highly advanced and powerful exosuit. Increases in powers represent the character becoming proficient with its abilities, recovering them, or the character becoming strong enough to support those systems being used. Invention would typically be more represented by an Inventor Warsmith.

But this is a roleplaying game! Do what fits for your character! A combination of backgrounds, ability scores, feats, and subclass can represent a huge range of characters.

EXOSUIT

Starting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you become bonded to the exosuit, though you need not necessarily always be wearing it. You are permanently connected to it in some way, and even if it is lost or destroyed, it recovers itself through its bond to you.

In its dormant state, it has a small collapsed form, recedes into your body, or has no form at all (based on its nature). When you enter a rage, it is activated, becoming a complete suit of armor. It subsumes whatever armor you are wearing when it activates, adopting the AC of that armor (if you are not wearing armor, it has the AC of your Unarmored Defense). In addition, it grants you the following properties:

 • Regenerating Armor. Your exosuit protects you from blows, reducing the damage you take by your proficiency bonus.
 • Iron Fists. If you are not carrying anything in your hand, that hand is treated as a weapon that deals 1d8 bludgeoning damage with the light property.
 • Smashing Force. Whenever you succeed on an Athletics (Strength) check to shove or grapple a creature, you can deal 1d4 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage to the target creature.

EMPOWERED MOVEMENT

Starting at 6th level, your integration with your exosuit grants you new movement options. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed, and the distance you can jump is tripled.

POWER FIST

Also at 6th level, when you make an attack roll with your Iron Fists, you can choose to forgo adding your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you can add double your Proficiency bonus to the damage roll.

Additionally, your Iron Fists count as magical for the Purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

HEAVY LIFTING

Starting at 10th level, while you are raging, when you are moving a grappled creature, your speed is no longer halved.

SLAM

Additionally at 10th level, once per turn during your turn, when you are moving a creature you have grappled, you can smash them into various features of the battlefield. If the grappled creature’s movement is stopped by colliding with a Large or larger object, a Small or larger creature, or immobile terrain, the grappled creature and the object it collides with both take 1d6 bludgeoning damage for each 15 feet you had moved prior to the collision.

INFINITE LEAP

Starting at 14th level, while you are raging, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed.

COLLEGE OF THUNDER

Some bards grow in talent, weaving beautiful ballads that move their listeners to tears. Some bards just turn up the volume. The College of Thunder is a path for those who want to be heard—to convey their message with great emphasis to as many people as possible. They often are keenly interested in innovating their instruments, finding new improvements that allow them to make new, louder, sounds... even if the musicality of those sounds is sometimes debated by more classical artists.

Lacking in subtlety, these bards are viewed as innovators and pioneers by themselves... and generally a large pain in the ears by most others, especially their preceding generation.

DRAMATIC CANTRIPS

At 3rd level, you become quite adept at getting loud. You learn the thaumaturgy and thunder noteK cantrips, which don’t count against the number of bard cantrips you know.

HARSH CHORD

Starting at 3rd level, as an action you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to play a powerful chord that sweeps outward. Each creature of your choice within 20 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes thunder damage equal to your bardic inspiration die + your bard level on a failed saving throw, and half as much damage on a successful one. Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on spells triggered by this damage are made with disadvantage.

THUNDERING MAGIC

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Additionally at 3rd level, you gain access to an expanded spell list. You learn the following spells at the following levels, and they do not count against the number of bard spells known. The following spells are considered bard spells for you even if they don’t normally appear on the bard list.

Starting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals thunder damage, you can add your Charisma modifier to the damage dealt.

AMPLIFIED ANTICS

Additionally at 6th level, when you cast a bard spell with a range greater than 5 feet, the range increases by 30 feet (this doesn’t affect the area of spells, including spells with their area listed in their range such as thunderwave).

REVERBERATING ECHO

At 14th level, when you expend a spell slot to cast a spell that deals thunder damage, you can cast that spell again on your next turn without expending a spell slot, but the damage it deals is halved.

MYSTERY CULT

While most clerics follow defined gods who seek to convert others to the cause, those of the Mystery Cults often intentionally obscure their faith with esoteric references and cloaked intentions. No less devoted than their more classically divine peers, they are not merely warlocks, but people of true faith in their dark and unknown deities.

Standing at the blasphemous confluence of divine and psionic power, they are almost universally condemned and feared, often shrouding their nature and abilities with mystery and working toward esoteric goals.

DOMAIN SPELLS

You gain domain spells at the cleric levels listed in the Mystery Cult Domain Spells table.

Mystery Cult Domain Spells

Cleric Level	Feature
1st	frighten*, terrifying visions*
3rd	augury, detect thoughts
5th	fear, nondetection
7th	compulsion, summon horror*
9th	dominate person, modify memory

SILENT LANGUAGE

Starting when you choose this domain at 1st level, you can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you, and they can reply in kind. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

UNCANNY INSIGHT

Additionally at 1st level, as a reaction to being hit by an attack, you can add your Wisdom to your AC until the start of your next turn, including against the triggering attack.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

CHANNEL DIVINITY: INVOKE BETRAYAL

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to influence the mind of a target within range. When a creature within 30 feet makes an attack roll, as a reaction you can force that creature to make a Wisdom saving throw. On failure, you can direct the attack at another creature within range.

ESOTERIC RITES

Starting at 6th level, you can develop your faith in one of the following ways, unlocking special powers as a reward for your conviction. You select one of the following features. You can select additional Esoteric Rites at 10th and 14th levels.

Gift of Tongues

You learn Deep Speech. If you already know Deep Speech, you gain one additional language of your choice. You can use this esoteric language as your verbal components, and creatures can no longer successfully identify a spell you are casting.

Spell casting checks to interfere with your magic are made with disadvantage (such as counterspell), and must make a check even if they would normally automatically succeed.

Gift of Prophecy

When you close your eyes, you can see flickers of the future. You regain one expended use of Uncanny Insight when you finish a short rest.

Gift of Mystery

You learn the associated psionic power of one Psionic Discipline of your choice. The psionic power of the Discipline becomes a 1st-level spell for you. When you cast it using a spell slot, you cast it as if expend psi points equal to the spell slot level spent (for example, when casting as a 1st-level spell, you cast it as if empowering it with 1 psi point).

POTENT SPELLCASTING

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.

DARK TRUTH

Starting at 17th level, your mind is inured to the horrors in which you deal, the veil cast aside from your eyes.

 • You are immune to psychic damage.
 • You gain a truesight of 60 feet.

CIRCLE OF NIGHTMARES

Druids are often thought of as the guardians of the natural order and having a deep connection to the creatures of the land. Sometimes that connection goes horribly wrong. A druid of this circle has found their mind entangled with the horrors of the beyond, their natural connection to nature and its beasts becoming warped by the dark dreams.

Druids of this circle may be haunted by the terrors they see, but many simply find their minds inoculated against the horror (perhaps by the touch of madness). Some even treat twisted abominations with the same care other druids might take to vicious and wild animals, treating them with pragmatic understanding and empathy.

Sometimes their connection even seems to be mutual.

At 2nd level, you learn the message cantrip. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access to the spells listed for that level in the Circle of the Nightmares Spells table. Once you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the druid spell list, the spell is nonetheless a druid spell for you.

ELDRITCH MUTATION

When you choose this circle at 2nd level, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature as a bonus action to take on an eldritch mutation born of your twisted nightmares, rendering a piece of them into reality through the warping of your flesh.

When you use this feature, you gain temporary hit points equal to your druid level + your Wisdom modifier and grow your choice of an Eye Stalk or Grasping Tentacles. The selected eldritch mutation lasts for 10 minutes. It ends early if you dismiss it as an action, are incapacitated, or use this feature again.

Eye Stalk

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
When you manifest this mutation, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can target a creature you can see within 60 feet and make a roll on the following table to shoot a random eye ray at them.

XXXXXXXX
1d6	Eye Ray	Effect

When you manifest this mutation, and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can lash out with these tentacles. You can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet. On hit, the target takes 1d6 + your Wisdom modifier bludgeoning damage. In place of making this attack, you can initiate a grapple against a target, making a Wisdom (Athletics) check with a range of 10 feet. If the check succeeds, you can continue to use Wisdom (Athletics) to maintain and contest grapples targeting that creature. You have a number of tentacles equal to your Wisdom modifier, and need at least one free tentacle to take the bonus action attack.

 • Druid: Circle of Nightmares

TECH KNIGHT

A Tech Knight believes that it is neither brains nor brawn that determine the best fighter, but the combination thereof.

Why limit yourself to what nature has provided you when you can supplement your combat superiority in unique and inventive ways that give you the edge? You build and innovate on the cutting edge... and use that edge to hew through your foes. There are few things more dangerous than weaponized creativity in the hands of someone that knows how to use it.

A Tech Knight could be called an inventor that opened the door of innovation, found the deadliest thing they could invent, and closed it once more, but that wouldn’t be accurate. They innovate continuously, improving their art, just with a highly specialized focus.

Some perhaps adventure and fight to test their weapons, others perhaps turned to innovation to overcome some obstacle or seek to change the world, and others still care little for the science and engineering of the weapon, and merely cobbled together something to annihilate their foes.

BRUTAL INVENTION

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you build a devastating new weapon to help you dominate the battlefield in a unique way. You can build one weapon.

Select one weapon from the below list:

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
XXXX

### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Variant Weapon Types

If a Tech Knight wants to change the damage type of a weapon to another, this is generally balanced. For example, Ramming Gauntlets that are Bladed Gloves that deal slashing damage, or a Ricocheting Weapon that does slashing damage.

The damage type of weapons in the games are not a primary factor in balance.
### Layout: end frame

You gain proficiency with the selected weapon. Only you have proficiency with this weapon. If your weapon is lost or destroyed, you can remake it over the course of 4 hours spending 25 gp of materials.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Special Properties

Chainblade. When you roll damage dice for this weapon, you can reroll as many damage dice as you would like once per attack, but you must use the new roll for any dice rolled this way. After hitting an attack with this weapon as part of the Attack action, if you have additional attacks you can make as part of the action, you can forgo them to deal an extra 4d4 slashing damage per attack forgone.

Ramming Gauntlet. When you make an attack roll, you can choose to forgo adding your proficiency bonus to the attack roll. If the attack hits, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the damage roll.

Repeating Hand Crossbow. This weapon doesn’t require a free hand to load, as it has a built-in loader. Once per turn, if you make an attack with this weapon as part of the Attack action, if you do not have disadvantage on that attack, you can give yourself disadvantage to make a single additional weapon attack with this weapon as a bonus action (also with disadvantage).

Ricocheting Weapon. When this weapon is thrown you can target two creatures within 10 feet of each other, using the same attack roll and damage roll for both targets; the damage dealt is halved for targets hit after the first. This weapon returns to your hand after you make an attack with it using the Thrown property. When you create this weapon, you can choose for it to deal slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage.

Transforming Weapon. When you gain this weapon, select 3 simple or martial weapons. This weapon can transform between any of those weapons as a bonus action. When you convert the weapon, it becomes overcharged with power, and the next time you roll damage with it before the end of your turn you deal an extra 1d4 lightning damage.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Rev Up

When hit an attack with your Brutal Invention, you can overcharge with an effect based on your Brutal Invention selection, granting it an additional benefit:

 • Reckless Power (Chainblade): The weapon’s damage dice become d6’s for that attack (including the special property if activated).
 • Excessive Force (Ramming Gauntlet): The target is knocked 10 feet backwards.
 • Full Auto (Repeating Hand Crossbow): You immediately make a single additional attack as part of the same action, making the attack with disadvantage; this disadvantage can’t be canceled out.
 • Overcharge (Transforming Weapon): You deal an extra 2d4 lightning damage.
 • Hypervelocity (Ricocheting Weapon): The weapon can target creatures within20 feet of each other, and it can bounce to an additional target.

You can use this ability a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1), regaining all uses on a short or long rest.

Weapon Improvement

Additionally at 3rd level, over the course of a long rest, you can destroy a +1/+2/+3 magic weapon to transfer its bonus to attack and damage rolls to your Brutal Invention weapon. At the GM’s discretion, other properties can be transferred (it is recommended that most cannot, but a final decision is up to the GM).
### Layout: end frame

Changing Your Invention

If a player wishes to change their Brutal Invention, it takes 1 full day of down time, working for at least 8 hours. You can change any option that requires a selection in this manner.

TINKER’S PROFICIENCY

Additionally at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with tinker’s tools. If you already have proficiency in tinker’s tools, you can select another type of artisan’s tools to gain proficiency in.

CONTINGENT OPTIONS

At 7th level, you extend your innovation of the art of war to give yourself a unique advantage from your gear. For any option that has a spell save DC, your save is 8 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency bonus. Select one of the following options:

 • Charged Armor. As a bonus action, you can juice your armor with power with the effect of the lightning charged* spell.
 • Rocket Boots. As a bonus action you can activate these to give yourself a jumping distance equal to your walking speed until the end of the turn. You take no fall damage from this movement, but creatures of your choice within 5 feet of where you land take 2d4 fire damage. Alternatively, you can use this to cast feather fall targeting only yourself.
 • Shifting Belt. You can use this to cast enlarge/reduce without expending a spell slot.
 • Flame Thrower. As an action or in place of one attack as part of the Attack action, you can use this to cast burning hands as a 2nd-level spell without expending a spell slot.
 • Force Shield. You can deploy a temporary force field, with the effect of casting shield .
 • Thunder Grenade. As an action or in place of one attack as part of the Attack action, you can use this to cast shatter without expending a spell slot.

You can use the selected item once, after which you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.

CHAINS OF WAR

Starting at 10th level, you can select one of the following, or one additional selection from Brutal Invention or Contingent Options.

 • Returning Chain. When you throw your Brutal Invention weapon at a target within 30 feet of you, you can return the weapon to your hand. If the weapon doesn’t have the thrown property, it gains the Thrown (10/30 property).
 • Grappling Hook. As an action, or in place of an attack as part of the Attack action, you may target a surface, object or creature within 20 feet. If the target is Small or smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) grappling check to pull it to you and grapple it. Alternatively, if the target is Medium or larger, you can choose to be pulled to it, however, this doesn’t grapple it. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement are made with disadvantage.

REACTIVE ARMOR

Starting 15th level, you can tune your armor during a long rest to grant specialized defense. At the end of a long rest, select one damage type and gain resistance to that damage type until the end of your next long rest.

ARMS RACE

Starting at 18th level, you can select two additional options from any of Brutal Invention, Contingent Options, and Chains of War (two options total, selected from any of those features).

WAY OF THE SOUL BLADE

Monks of the Way of the Soul Blade are monks who have learned to harness and focus their ki, using their inner will and focus to control psionic powers—primarily into a blade of pure psionic power: a Soul Blade.

SOUL BLADE

Starting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you’ve learned to focus your ki into a psionic blade. As a bonus action, you can create a blade of pure scintillating psionic energy. The blade you create this way most typically takes the form of a knife-like blade projecting from your fist, but you can shape it however you choose. You can choose to create multiple blades, but any blade you are not touching vanishes at the end of your turn and must be resummoned.

Regardless of the form it takes, the weapon is a monk weapon for you, deals 1d8 psychic damage, and has the light, finesse, and thrown(20/60) properties.

PSIONIC KI

Additionally at 3rd level, you gain the Telekinetics Discipline; this can be found under the Psionic Disciplines list of the psion class. You can use ki points as psi points, with a limit of 1 ki point. This limit increases to 2 ki points at level 5, 3 ki points at level 9, 4 ki points at level 13, and 5 ki points at level 17. The DC for your psionic abilities is equal to your ki save DC.

If your character has both psi points and ki points, those are added together into one pool and can be used interchangeably. Your psi limit (and the limit you can use ki points as psi points) becomes your psi limit + one third of your monk levels rounded down.

When you use your action on a psionic power or to cast a spell using this feature, you can make one attack with an unarmed strike or monk weapon as a bonus action before the end of your turn.

ART OF THE SOUL BLADE

Starting at 6th level, your expertise with the blade allows you to control it in unique and powerful ways

EXTENDED BLADE

You can expend 1 ki point to give your Soul Blade the Reach property until the end of your turn.

PSIONIC FLURRY

When you make a Flurry of Blows, you can make the additional attacks with your Soul Blade.

SOUL STRIKE

When you take the Attack action, you use your soul blade to make a single piercing strike. Make a single attack using your action (forgoing any additional attacks gained from Extra Attack) to ignore all armor a creature has and treat its AC as 10 + its Dexterity. On a hit, the creature takes additional damage equal to your Wisdom modifier.

POWER OF THE MIND

Starting at 11th level, your psionic abilities manifest more completely, giving you greater control and power in your psionic abilities.

ETHEREAL SWEEP

When you use Extended Blade, you can sweep or stab through multiple creatures with a single blow. Once per turn, when you make an attack with your Soul Blade, if you have activated Extended Blade you can make a single additional weapon attack with your Soul Blade against a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier within range.

CONSUMPTIVE BLADE

Whenever you kill a creature with your Soul Blade that has an Intelligence of 6 or higher, you can use your reaction to draw in part of their psionic essence. You regain 1d4 hit points and 1 expended ki point.

EMPOWERED DISCIPLINE

When you use a Psionic Discipline, you can expend 1 ki point for free without exhausting the ki point on empowering the psionic power granted by the Discipline, even if you do not have any remaining ki (this can’t be used on the spells granted by the Discipline).

TRANSCENDENT BLADE

Starting at 17th level, your Soul Blade becomes a peerless weapon. You can add a +1 to its attack and damage rolls. You can choose for your blade to affect inanimate material, causing it to gain the Siege property and deal force damage to it when you choose. Reactions that parry or block to add Armor Class against an attack are ineffective against attacks made with the Soul Blade.

Additionally, critical hits from your Soul Blade rend the soul of the target. If a creature would have less than 50 hit points after taking damage from your critical strike, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. On failure, its Charisma score becomes zero and it dies.

SOUL BLADE QUIRKS

OATH OF SANITY

The following oath is a new subclass option for the Paladin, for those that wish to battle the psionic horrors from beyond.

OATH OF SANITY

The Oath of Sanity is the oath of someone that has survived exposure to the horrors that lay beyond the veil, or perhaps someone that has prepared for them through a mystical order, a forgotten tradition... or particularly vivid and over active imagination.

While most who have glimpsed into the realms beyond suffer instant and irrevocable madness, these Paladins have glimpsed beyond and sworn to remain sane, no matter what the cost. They reject shielding their fragile mind from what they’ve seen in a comforting shroud of madness.

An Oath of Sanity Paladin will usually seem to others as true neutral or lawful neutral following obscure codes incomprehensible to those who haven’t experienced a brush with the beyond, their morality coming in blue and orange rather than black and white. Almost universally they are dedicated to preventing the threats from beyond from consuming the material world and shattering the fragile minds within.

TENETS OF SANITY

 • Order. Never act on random or chaotic impulses. These are the cracks of madness.
 • Vigilance. Never let your attention wander, lest you miss the signs of madness.
 • Discipline. Never indulge in a lapse of behavior, your habits keep you safe from madness.
 • Solemnity. Your work is terrible. Never take pleasure in it. That leads to the comfort of madness
 • Sanity. No matter what, never give into madness.

OATH SPELLS

You gain oath Spells at the paladin levels listed.:

CHANNEL DIVINITY

When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

Turn the Aberrant. As an action, you can make any aberration or undead, provided that it’s within 30 feet and that can see or hear you, make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage. A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.

If the creature’s true form is concealed by an illusion, shapeshifting, or other effect, that form is revealed while it is turned.

Deny the Supernatural. Immediately after you deal damage to a creature with your Divine Smite feature, you can use your Channel Divinity as a bonus action to attempt to strip the target of its powers. The target must make a Charisma saving throw or be unable to cast spells or use psionic abilities until the end of its next turn.

ACTIVE MIND

Beginning at 7th level, you can save against effects that allow you to save at the end of your turn at the start of your turn instead.

Starting at 18th level, you can use your reaction to extend this benefit to another creature you can see within 30 feet that starts their turn under an effect they can save against at the end of their turn.

CONSTANT VIGILANCE

Starting at 15th level, you can no longer be surprised, and your passive perception remains the same even while unconscious so long as you have at least 1 hit point.

Additionally, when you roll for initiative, if the total result of your roll is less than your passive perception, you can replace the result with your passive perception value.

CLARITY OF PURPOSE

At 20th level, as an action, you can fully perceive the world around you for what it is, shattering the foul magics that bind and piercing the veils that hide, unrelenting and focused, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

 • You can gain truesight with a range of 120 feet.
 • You are immune to psychic damage.
 • You have advantage on saving throws against magical or psionic effects.
 • When you strike an enemy with a Divine Smite you can choose to cast dispel magic on the target as a bonus action without expending a spell slot. If the level of the spell slot spent on Divine Smite was higher than 3rd level, you cast dispel magic at the level of spell slot spent.

Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

OATH OF SANITY QUIRKS

The following are some optional quirks for a player of this Oath to choose from. These can be either preexisting, signaling their inevitable path toward this Oath, or appear over time due to the influence of their experiences. It is recommended that you have two quirks from this table... This Oath rarely results in individuals that would be considered normal.

Some use these powers to spread fear, savoring the terror of their victims. Others use their powers to dispense what they view as justifice, stalking down and reaping only those they believe have earned such a grim fate.

MIND REAPER SPELLS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Starting at 3rd level, you learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Mind Reaper Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know.

PSYCHIC REAPER

At 3rd level, when you attack a creature that is frightened, you gain advantage on the attack roll.

Additionally, you learn to imbue your attacks with lingering psionic energy. When you make an attack as part of the attack action, your attack deals an extra 1d4 psychic damage.

TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION

Additionally at 3rd level, you can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.

REAPER’S INTRUSION

Starting at 7th level, you gain the Telepathic Intrusion psionic power. You gain a number of psi points equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining them on a short or long rest. You can use these points to empower your Telepathic Intrusion or cast spells granted by the subclass, spending 1 psi point per level of the spell in place of a spell slot.

TELEPATHIC INTRUSION

Psionic power

Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 60 feet
 Components: S
 Duration: Instantaneous

You assault the mind of a creature you can see directly. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC, or take 1d8 psychic damage. If the target fails the saving throw, it has disadvantage on attacks made against you until the start of your next turn. You can choose to deal no damage to the creature when it fails its saving throw.

The points must be spent when choosing the target of the power.

Rending (1+ psi points): The target takes 1d8 psychic damage for each additional point spent on a failed save.

Terrifying (1 psi point): The target is frightened of you until the end of your next turn if it fails its saving throw.

Meddling (2 psi points): You make one creature invisible to the target creature or cause the creature to see something that is not there with the effect of minor illusion until the start of your next turn if it fails its saving throw.

Overwhelming (3 psi points): The target is stunned until the end of its next turn if it fails its saving throw.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Reaper vs Intrusion

Psychic Reaper offers no saving throw, and consequently deals guaranteed damage in the cases you can use it. Telepathic Intrusion deals the same amount of damage and causes additional effects, but gives the target a saving throw. One is not always better than the other, though when spending psi points the Telepathic Intrusion can offer far more damage and utility at the corresponding higher risk that it might fail.

AMPLIFIED ANGUISH

Starting at 11th level, whenever you deal psychic damage to a creature that is frightened of you, you deal an extra 1d8 psychic damage.

MIND HUNTER

Additionally at 11th level, when you’ve dealt psychic damage to a creature, you gain the ability to see that target as if by blindsight as long as it is within 120 feet of you until the end of your next turn.

TASTE OF FEAR

Starting at 15th level, when you deal psychic damage to a frightened creature, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus. If a creature dies while frightened of you, you regain 1 expend psi point.

PSIONIC ADAPTATION

Additionally at 15th level, you can expend your spell slots in place of psi points when using a psionic power, with a spell slot counting as an equal number of psi points.

 • Ranger: Mind Reaper

GADGETEER

Swinging from a grappling hook before dropping a smoke bomb, rigging a stubborn lock to blow, or rejiggering traps to spring on those that set them, the Gadgeteer lives by fast paced innovation and thinking outside the box on the fly... sometimes literally.

Specializing tools that let themselves get in and out of trouble, they don’t fight fair, relying on things that go "boom", "zap" or "whirr". They live on the edge of their own explosions, though often rewriting the story in later retellings that they doffed their darkened goggles as they walked away slowly, omitting the singed seat of their trousers and yelping.

GADGET DC

Your gadgets are a combination of innovative mechanical parts and magic. You use your Intelligence for gadget-based effects when they refer to a spell attack roll or spell save DC.

Gadget DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

Gadget modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

TINKER’S KNACK

When you choose this presence archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with tinker’s tools. If you already have proficiency with tinker’s tools, you gain expertise with tinker’s tools (if you already have expertise with tinker’s tools, you gain proficiency with another tool of your choice, or expertise with another proficient tool).

Grappling Hook

Starting at 3rd level, you’ve mastered both the creation and use of your most important gadget, the grappling hook. As an action or with the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action, you may target a surface, object or creature within 20 feet. If the target is Small or smaller, you can make a Strength (Athletics) check to pull it to you and grapple it (automatically succeeding against objects that are not being worn or carried unless the GM sets a difficulty for a particularly complicated scenario).

Alternatively, if the target is Medium or larger, you can choose to be pulled to it. This automatically succeeds, but this doesn’t grapple it, though if it is a surface or large object, you can choose to hold onto at the point you grappled if there is something to grab onto. Opportunity attacks provoked by this movement are made with disadvantage.

PYROTECHNIC GADGETS

Additionally at 3rd level, you gain access to an important arsenal of things that explode. Forgoing some subtlety for firepower, you gain the following options:

Smoke Bomb. As an action, you can use this to cast fog cloud centered on yourself without expending a spell slot. It lasts a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier and doesn’t require concentration. When you cast fog cloud in this way, you can set the radius at 5, 10, 15, or 20 feet.

Explosive Surprise. As an action you can toss explosives at a point within 30 feet. Creatures within 5 feet of the target point must make a Dexterity saving throw against your Gadget DC or take thunder damage equal to your Sneak Attack damage. If you are hidden from a creature, it makes the Dexterity saving throw with disadvantage. This counts as dealing Sneak Attack damage and reveals your location if you are hidden.

Shaped Charge. As an action, you can place a charge on an object, building or surface within 5 feet. At the start of your next turn, the charge detonates, dealing thunder damage equal to your Sneak Attack damage to the object, building or surface it was placed on, and half as much damage to any creature within 5 feet of it.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Unlimited Uses?

Pyrotechnic Gadgets are balanced around the assumption of unlimited use and rogues typically speaking do not have rest gated resources, but practically speaking their supply is not truly infinite, just higher than generally makes sense to be worth tracking. If you would like a number to track, you can use proficiency bonus + Intelligence modifier uses of Pyrotechnic Gadget per short rest.

CLEVER INVENTIONS

Starting at 9th level, you expand your selection. Select two of the following options:

Gliding Cloak. You make a cloak that allows you to glide when falling. When you fall more than 10 feet and aren’t incapacitated, can spread this cloak to reduce your falling speed to 30 feet a round and take no falling damage. While falling in this manner toward the ground under normal gravity, you can move horizontally 2 feet for every 1 foot you descend.

Mechanical Arm. You create a mechanical arm, giving you an extra hand. This mechanical arm only functions while it is mounted on gear you are wearing, but can be operated mentally without the need for your hands. This mechanical arm can serve any function a normal hand could, such as holding things, making attacks, and interacting with the environment, but it doesn’t grant you any additional actions.

Mechanical Familiar. You can create the blueprint for a small mechanical creature. At the end of a long rest, you can choose to create a mechanical familiar based on it, and cast find familiar spell without expending a spell slot. The familiar’s type is Construct. This construct stays active until you deactivate it or it is destroyed. In either case, you can choose to reactivate it at the end of a long rest.

Sight Lenses. You create a set of lenses you can integrate into a set of goggles, glasses, or other vision assistance that allow you to see through darkness and obscurement. You can see through fog, mist, smoke, clouds, and nonmagical darkness as normal sight up to 15 feet.

AMONG THE BLASTS

Additionally at 9th level, when you successfully avoid damage from an area of effect with your Evasion feature (including from your own effects), you can use your reaction to move up to your speed to the edge of the effect. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

DEADLY SURPRISE

Starting at 13th level, your technical expertise expands. The radius of your explosive surprise becomes 10 feet, and you can select one additional option from Clever Inventions.

At your GM’s discretion, you can select an upgrade from the Gadgetsmith list that requires 9th level or lower for your additional gadget.

ULTIMATE IMPROVISATION

Starting at 17th level, you can solve a wide array of problems with your Gadgets at a moment’s notice. Over the course of 1 minute you can construct a gadget capable of casting any spell of 4th level or lower on the Wizard or Inventor list. This gadget lasts until used, or you construct another gadget (dissembling it in the process).

You can do this a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier before you must finish a long rest to create additional improvised gadgets with the feature.

 • Rogue: Gadgeteer

AETHER HEART

Sorcerers of this origin are fueled by a deep connection to raw arcane energy, their soul touched by the raw stuff of the weave itself. Most of them don’t understand their connection to this power, but they can wield it with innate ease, manipulating magic by force of will alone.

Sometimes this is artificial in nature—an ironwrought drawing power from their arcane heart, for example—while other times this marks an individual that was exposed to the raw essence of aether, becoming infused and intrinsically linked to it. They are characterized by an easy affinity of warping magic and ease of manipulating it in its raw and purest forms.

AETHERBORN

When you choose this origin at 1st level, your aether heart gives you several advantages. You have resistance to force damage, and can serve as your own arcane focus.

When you reach 3rd level, you automatically gain the Empowered Spell metamagic option, and can use it without spending sorcery points a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a long rest.

OVERCHARGED METAMAGIC

Starting at 6th level, you can unleash the power that rages within your heart. When you modify a spell that deals damage with your Metamagic options, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell.

ARCANE FUEL

At 14th level, you gain immunity to force damage. When you would take force damage, you regain health equal to half the damage you would have taken. You can gain a maximum amount of hit points this way equal to your sorcerer level, after which you no longer gain additional hit points until you finish a short or long rest.

Additionally, you learn the spell dispel magic , or another sorcerer spell of your choice if you already know it. Dispel magic doesn’t count against your spells known. When you successfully cast dispel magic or counterspell , you regain an expanded sorcery point (if you are not currently at your maximum) as you draw in the remnants of the broken magic.

TAP POWER

At 18th level, you can tap the power that surges through to replenish your magic. As a bonus action, you can expend one Hit Die and regain sorcery points equal to the number rolled + your Charisma modifier. Once you do this, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

PLANETOUCHED

Connected to planes beyond their own, these sorcerers find the walls between the planes thinner, they pull power from beyond them or step through them with greater ease.

Perhaps they were born in the ethereal plane or became connected to an outer plane, they now find themselves with one foot in the material and one foot beyond.

RIFTBORN

Starting at 1st level, when you draw on your magic, the planar walls begin to weaken for you. After casting a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use Phase Rift as a bonus action.

You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a long rest.

PHASE RIFT

Psionic power

Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 10 feet

You step through space traveling up to 10 feet in a straight line leaving a spatial tear behind. You can pass through creatures but can’t pass through objects, buildings or terrain more than 4 inches thick. Any creature in the path of this tear must make a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d8 force damage.

SORCEROUS RIFTS

Starting at 14th level, you can cast Phase Rift as an action at will. In addition, when you use Phase Rift, you can expend a sorcery point to make it both Long and Disruptive, causing you to move an additional 10 feet and deal an extra 1d8 damage to creatures that fail their save against it.

Disruptive: Each target that fails their saving throw takes an extra 1d8 force damage.

Long: You can travel an additional 10 feet.

ETHEREAL CONTROL

Additionally at 14th level, you can expend 1 sorcery point to reroll the value of a die rolled for blink or flicker* . Once you do this, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.

PLANAR COLLISION

At 18th level you can draw planes together causing them to smash together with devastating results. Select a plane to intersect the one you are on, you can’t select the plane you are currently on. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to cause the planar intersection to occur at a point you can see within 120 feet, causing effects to occur based on the table below in a 30-foot-radius sphere around the chosen point. The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier.

XXXXXXX
Plane	Effect
Shadow	The area is plunged into darkness and can’t be illuminated by natural or magical means.
Fey	Magic in the area goes haywire. A creature that casts a spell in the area or that targets a point within the area must succeed a Charisma saving throw when casting a spell, or a random spell from their spell list of that level or lower is cast (at the level of the spell they were trying to cast). Damage and healing dice are maximized for spells cast in the area.
Fire	The area is incinerated by fire. Creatures that end their turn within the area take 10d10 fire damage. This damage ignores resistance.
Ice	The area freezes over. Creatures that end their turn within the area must make a Constitution saving throw or take 3d12 cold damage and become stunned frozen in ice until the end of their next turn.
Earth	The area becomes filled with stone and earth, shoving all creatures out of it outward from the center. If this would trap them into a wall they take 3d12 bludgeoning damage and are shoved to the closest free space.
Radiant	All creatures that end their turn in the area take 6d6 radiant damage. All living creatures that end their turn in the area are healed for 3d6 hit points.
Beyond	All creatures that end their turn within the area must make a Wisdom saving throw or take 3d12 psychic damage and be affected by the effects of the confusion spell.

Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

 • Sorcerer: Planetouched Origin

THE ANCIENT INTELLIGENCE

You have made a pact of sorts with an intelligence that defies normal understanding; its aims are mysterious and often incomprehensible. This being could be an artificial intelligence of some lost race of ancients with fabulous technology, perhaps a high ranking mechanical overmind. They could even be an ancient lost rogue one, perhaps an Inventor of another era whose last act was to upload themselves in an incorporeal form, or perhaps it something more alien, the ancient navigation system of an otherworldly ship that has gained sentience.

The possibilities are endless, but whatever its nature, it can grant you sufficiently advanced knowledge that for all intents and purposes is fabulous magical power.

EXPANDED SPELL LIST

At 1st level, the Ancient Intelligence lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The Ancient Intelligence Spells table shows the spells that are added to the warlock spell list for you:

The Ancient Intelligence Expanded Spells

XXXX
Spell Level	Ancient Intelligence Spells
1st	identify, seeking projectile*
2nd	animate object*, locate object
3rd	clairvoyance, crushing singularity*
4th	arcane eye, locate creature
5th	arcane hand, commune

THE CONTRAPTION

At 1st level, you gain access to a device granted to by your patron that grants some access to their vast knowledge, systems, and power. Your contraption is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.

If the contraption is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron.

This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous contraption is destroyed if it still exists. The contraption may vanish in a flash of light when you die.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Form of the Contraption

The form of your contraption can vary based on your selection of pact, perhaps even adapting with its alien technology to suit your pact choice, taking the form of an exotic alien weapon, data storage device, or even unique familiar for Pact of the Chain (a GM can allow you to select "Construct" as the creature type of your familiar, for example, or consider if the contraption is perhaps the source of your eldritch blast or other Warlock magical effects.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

### Layout: end frame

While you are possession of the contraption, you gain the following benefits:

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Autocaster

Your contraption serves as a repository for additional spells. At the end of a long rest, you can store spells from your Expanded Spell List, or any spell of the divination school of magic that is of a level you could cast. You can have a combined prepared level of spells equal to your proficiency bonus (for example, at 5th level when your proficiency bonus is +3, you can have it store three 1st-level spells, or one 3rd-level spell).

Each spell stored in the Autocaster can be cast without expending a warlock spell slot to cast the spell once, after which you can’t cast it without expending a spell slot again until you finish a long rest. You can cast the spell stored again before finishing a long rest by expending a warlock spell slot of equal or greater level to the stored spell.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Firing Solution

Your contraption begins to develop the best way to hit a target. While you possess your contraption, you can use it to cast true strike. You can accelerate the calculations and cast true strike as a bonus action a number of times equal to your Spellcasting modifier. When you cast true strike using your contraption, it doesn’t require concentration.

You can do this a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier before you must finish a long rest to do so again.

ANCIENT INVOCATIONS

Starting at 6th level, your patron grants you another fragment of their vast power in the form of a gadget or tool. Your Invocations Known increases by 1, but one of your invocations must be from the options described in this feature.

Battle Drones (Prerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature, drone swarm familiar) 
Your Drone swarm can attack without you using your action to direct it attack. Its attack modifier becomes equal to your spell attack modifier.

Data Bank 
While in possession of your contraption, you gain proficiency in two of Arcana, History, Medicine, or Nature which are selected when you gain this Invocation.

Dispatch Relay 
You can use your Autocaster to cast sending once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast it this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

Gliding Cloak 
You make a cloak that allows you to glide when falling. When you fall more than 10 feet and aren’t incapacitated, you can spread this cloak to reduce your falling speed to 30 feet a round take no falling damage. While falling in this manner toward the ground under normal gravity, you can move horizontally 2 feet for every 1 foot you descend.

Mechanical Arm 
You create a mechanical arm, giving you an extra hand. This mechanical arm only functions while it is mounted on gear you are wearing, but can be operated mentally without the need for your hands. This mechanical arm can serve any function a normal hand could, such as holding things, making attacks, interacting with the environment, etc, but doesn’t give you any additional actions.

Personal Shield 
You gain the Armor of Shadows invocation. It doesn’t count against your Invocations known.

Neural Link 
When you calculate a firing solution, it now applies to your current turn. Additionally, when you benefit from true strike, you negate the disadvantage of being unable to see a target (such as invisible or obscured target).

SAVE STATE

Starting at 10th level, as a bonus action you can cause your Contraption to record your existence. Record your hit points, location, and any conditions you are affected by. At the start of your next turn, your current hit points, location, and conditions are returned to the saved state in a flash of light. If you die while having your save state, you can make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw (making the check as if you were alive) when the start of your next turn would have been. On success, you return as normal. On failure, you remain dead.

Once you use this, you can’t use this again until you finish a long rest.

SYNCHRONIZATION

Starting at 14th level, at the start of your turn (no action required) you can synchronize yourself with your Contraption, entering a cold and logical mental state of absolute focus until the start of your next turn. While in this state of synchronization, you gain the following benefits:

 • You are immune to the charmed and frightened conditions.
 • You can cast spells with the casting time of 1 action as 1 bonus action.
 • You gain advantage on all Intelligence and Wisdom checks and saving throws, as well as Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on a spell.

You can be synchronized for a number of turns equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum 1), after which you can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

Variant Warlock: Intelligence

The designers of 5e noted that it was originally their intention to make the Warlock an Intelligence caster, and that making Intelligence the Warlock spellcasting ability doesn’t break anything.

With the approval of your GM, this subclass may be a thematic fit for an Intelligence-based Warlock who studies their Contraption and tries to understand its knowledge and secrets. If you do, use Intelligence in place of Charisma for any Warlock feature that mentions Charisma.

Your patron is defined by its sheer incomprehensibility to the mortal mind, an existence that is the very anathema of sanity itself, where any attempt to truly describe its nature is the gibbering of a mad man.

The most tame examples of these may have names or euphemisms that mortals know them as, while others may be concepts that most mortal minds remain blissfully incapable of knowing the existence of.

The patron need not be aware of your existence or invested in it for their power to have affected you, fundamentally warping your mind and granting you powers. Most that would have this opportunity have their mind shattered, left tattered and insane by the experience, but you’ve managed to hang onto some semblance of sanity and wield the power grafted into your mind.

EXPANDED SPELL LIST

At 1st level, That Which Is Beyond lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. That Which Is Beyond Spells table shows the spells that are added to the warlock spell list for you:

That Which Is Beyond Expanded Spells

XXXXXXX
Spell Level	That Which is Beyond Spells
1st	terrifying visions*, hideous laughter
2nd	detect thoughts, psychic drain*
3rd	delve mind*, sending
4th	black tentacles, summon horror
5th	dominate person, dream

OPENED MIND

Starting at 1st level, your mind has interacted with something that is incompatible to a mortal understanding, forcing it to be opened and adapted to new ideas and powers. You gain the ability to communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don’t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language. That creature can reply in kind.

PSYCHIC ONSLAUGHT

Additionally at first level, when targeting a creature with a Warlock spell or attack roll, you can use your Telepathic Intrusion on them as a bonus action, assaulting them on both a physical and psychic level.

You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses on a long rest. You can only use Telepathic Intrusion through this feature under the conditions it sets, unless you obtain it from another source.

TELEPATHIC INTRUSION

Psionic power

Casting Time: 1 action
 Range: 60 feet
 Components: S Duration: Instantaneous

You assault the mind of a creature you can see directly. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or take 1d8 psychic damage. If the target fails the saving throw, it has disadvantage on attacks made against you until the start of your next turn. You can choose to deal no damage to the creature when it fails its saving throw.

GIBBERING TERROR

Starting at 6th level, when you use the Telepathic Intrusion power, you always add the Terrifying modifier, causing the target to be frightened of you until the end of your next turn if it fails its saving throw.

When they fail the saving throw by 5 or more, they additionally lose the ability to speak while frightened in this way, gibbering in fear in confusion.

ALIEN MIND

Additionally at 6th level, you have advantage on saving throws against being magically charmed or frightened.

REBOUND INTRUSION

Starting at 10th level, if a creature attempts to read your mind, you can make a Wisdom saving throw against the effect even if it would normally not allow a save. If it would normally allow a save, you have advantage on the save. If you succeed the save, you can instead read their mind, as if by the detect thoughts spell (this effect doesn’t require concentration, but lasts only until the end of your next turn, and targets only the creature that attempted to read your mind).

Additionally, you gain resistance to psychic damage, and when a creature deals psychic damage to you, it takes an equal amount of psychic damage.

UNLEASHED PSYCHE

Starting at 14th level, you gain enough mental control to form the twisted nightmares that dwell within your mind into the world. As an action, targeting a point within 60 feet you spawn a malignant otherworldly nightmare, taking the form of a twisted aberration of terror.

The first time a creature other than you is within 20 feet of it during their turn (including starting their turn there), they must make a Wisdom saving throw. On failure they take 4d8 psychic damage and become frightened of it.

The spawned nightmare lasts until the start of your turn, when it fades away unless at least one creature has failed their saving throw against its effect, in which case it persists for another round (indefinitely until no creatures fail their saving throw against it, after which it fades away at the start of your next turn).

Once you use this ability, you can’t do so until you finish a short or long rest.

THE THAT WHICH IS BEYOND INVOCATIONS

Psionic Intrusion (Prerequisite: 7th level) 
You gain 2 psi points you can use to apply Telepathy Discipline modifiers to your Telepathic Intrusion. You regain these psi points on a short or long rest.

THE THAT WHICH IS BEYOND QUIRKS

ORDER OF CREATION

Wizards that belong to this order of thought seek to advance the application of magic through the merging of mechanical and magical pieces. They share much in common with Inventors in mind set, but delve deeper into the knowledge of magic, relying more heavily on it to power their mechanical inventions, and in turn creating mechanical inventions that more primarily serve to further their magic.

They often seek to look beyond tradition and common knowledge, to seek out new spells and new ways of doing things. The value of new research and new technology is often more than dusty old tomes unless those dusty old tomes contain secrets of those who had reached the heights they seek in ages gone by.

CRAFTING FUNDAMENTALS

Beginning when you select this school at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in tinker’s tools.

ARCANE AUTOMATON

Starting at 2nd level, you apply your skills of magic and creation to forge a small mechanical helper. The find familiar spell is added to your spellbook. (If its there already add another 1st level Wizard spell of your choosing) Its material component becomes tinker’s tools (they are not consumed on casting), and when you summon it gains the traits for the creature selected, as well as the following additional traits:

 • Its type becomes construct.
 • It acts on your turn.
 • It gains temporary hit points when summoned or at the end of a long rest equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level.
 • As long as it is within 30 feet of you, you can cast spells as if you were in its position.
 • Select three wizard cantrips you can cast. Your familiar can cast these cantrips, casting them (in total) a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus (casting them as a 1st level caster). It uses your spellcasting ability modifier when casting these spells. It regains all uses when you finish a long rest.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Automaton Appearance

Most arcane automatons look like a mechanical version of the creature selected for find familiar , but it can have any appearance as long as that appearance maintains the necessary configuration to have the traits it has (for example, some method of flying for flying familiars).

ARCANE GADGET

Additionally at 2nd level, when you prepare spells for the day, you can turn them into arcane gadgets. Select spells with a casting time of 1 action, 1 bonus action, or 1 reaction. These spells do not count against your spells prepared, but you build them into tiny gadgets. You expend the spell slot as normal for casting the spell, and can choose if you expend any material component with a gold piece cost to incorporate it into the gadget (if the material component is not consumed, it can be reclaimed after the gadget is used). Subsequently a creature holding the gadget can use the gadget to cast the spell; they do not require verbal or somatic components, but do require material components if they are not included in the gadget. The gadget loses its power if you use it to cast the spell, if you finish a long rest, or if you regain the spell slot expended to create it (such as with Arcane Recovery).

You can prepare a number spell slot levels this way equal to your Intelligence modifier (for example, if your Intelligence modifier is +3, you could prepare three 1st-level spells or one 3rd-level spell in this way). Creatures other than you can use your arcane gadgets.

Creatures that do so are treated as if they cast the spell though it uses your spellcasting modifiers and proficiency bonus. If the spell requires concentration, they must pass an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the spell’s level to cast the spell using the gadget. On a failure, the spell fizzles and is lost.

Any spell cast by the gadget ends when the wizard recovers the spell slot spent to create the arcane gadget.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

IMBUED GEAR

Starting at 6th level, select a 1st- or 2nd-level wizard spell, and forge it into a magical item. You can cast this spell once without expending a spell slot, regaining the ability to cast it again when you finish a long rest.

If the spell targets only you, has a duration of more than 10 minutes, and doesn’t require concentration, it lasts until you finish a long rest instead of its normal duration.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Extended Duration Spells

The spells that fit this criteria for expanding their duration include include:

 • 1st level: false life, longstrider, mage armor
 • 2nd level: continual flame, darkvision

### Layout: end frame

REVERSE ENGINEER

Additionally at 6th level, you gain the ability to reverse engineer the arcane magic of magic items. You can learn a spell from a magic item that can cast a Wizard spell as you would from a scroll, though the magic item is not destroyed in the process.

CLEVER CREATION

Starting at 10th level, your Arcane Automaton gains proficiency in two skills of your choice and can activate spells imbued in Arcane Gadgets without making an Intelligence (Arcana) check as long as the spell doesn’t require concentration. You can change what skills your familiar is proficient in when you summon it with find familiar again.

CREATOR’S VISION

Starting at 14th level, you can forge your Arcane Automation into new forms limited only by your creative vision. Select two of the following additional properties for it:

 • It becomes Medium or Large (your choice).
 • It gains a flying speed equal to its walking speed (if it doesn’t already have one).
 • It gains additional temporary hit points at the end of a long rest or when summoned equal to Wizard level (giving it combined total hit points equal to twice your Wizard level).
 • It can cast its cantrips as a 5th level caster, and regains half the uses of its cantrip casting when you use your Arcane Recovery feature.
 • It can cast a spell from an Arcane Gadget without making an Intelligence (Arcana) check even if the spell requires concentration, as long as the spell is 2nd level or lower.

You can select the same properties or new properties to replace them when you summon your familiar again with find familiar.

ORDER OF CREATION QUIRKS

The following are some optional quirks for a player that selects Order of Creation. You can optionally roll or select a quirk that suits your character.

 • Wizard: Order of Creation

MULTICLASSING

As should be apparent, many of these subclasses are built around the themes introduced by the Inventor and Psion class in Chapter 1. They are intended to be fully standalone, but as with all things, it’s likely that players will want to mix and match. I’m not going to try to define every interaction, simply offer the general guide that, where possible, things will probably be generally fine if they are allowed to interact as one would hope.

UPGRADES AND UPGRADE-LIKE THINGS

Many of the Inventor themed classes get things that are similar to upgrades, but gained through their features. Generally these features can be treated as a similar upgrade in most cases where it would matter.

For example, a Techknight that wants a quick way to get a second Ramming Gauntlet might opt to take a level of Inventor and pick up a Power Fist from Warsmith. This level of mixing and matching will result in some situations where the power curve will be lightly modified, but rarely result in any long term imbalances.

Likewise, if they had Arcane Retrofit from either class, I’d probably let them use that Arcane Retrofit on the similar item from the other class as well, even if they didn’t have the sufficient level of the other class.

The main exception to this general rule is that I would generally recommend anything that stacks a flat bonus to be, at very least, treated with caution.

PSI POINT INTERCHANGEABILITY

All classes that use Psi Points and Ki assume that these points are interchangeable in terms of balance and multiclassing. This might not be the case in your setting if Ki is a significantly different power than Psionics, but it should be fine either way.

Any time a subclass gets Psi Points, I would allow those to be used on Psion class features like normal. There are exceptions to this under the standard disclaimer of specifics. Psionic Mastery still only applies to psionic powers, and wouldn’t apply to features gained through other subclasses by default, unless they also have the psionic power tag.

ENGINEER

Scholars and academics are great, but many a kingdom has needed those of the more intellectual bent to put their ability to more practical uses: designing everything from siege equipment to bridges.

While construction may or may not have used magic here and there, at the end of the day something built without an engineer’s oversight is much more likely to fall back down when it is needed most.

FEATURE: BLUEPRINTS

Given one day to plan, you can produce blueprints or schematics for bridges, siege equipment, buildings, dams, or any other common feat of engineering that anyone proficient with the necessary artisan tools could follow to craft the outlined construction given the time and resources. Buildings more fantastical in nature may still be within your grasp to plan with skill-appropriate ability checks at the GM’s discretion.

TINKER

Falling somewhere between a merchant, a sage, and—if you ask some villagers—a vagabond, a Tinker wanders from town to town bringing a cart (or sometimes just a donkey) of knickknacks and knowhow. While not always welcomed with open arms, they can be a lifeline to the smallest and most widely flung towns, as no route is too odd and winding for them to wander. Tinkers may be wanderers by nature, but what opens doors is their useful knack for being able to fix problems with a dash of knowhow and ingenuity.

ADAPTING IRONWROUGHT

The Ironwrought are easy to adapt to many settings, though the nature of their origin may vary widely. Perhaps they are ancient relics of a magical empire recently unearthed or perhaps they were mass produced for a terrible war the world still remembers. Perhaps they are entirely unique hurled across time and space by forces unknown, and no one is more confused as to how they got there than the Ironwrought themselves.

While their lore is easy to adapt, their thematic presence may not fit all games. At the end of the day they are a concept more akin to sci-fi than the most classical of fantasy, and while the lines blur, setting up a world and what is in it is always the domain of the GM.

Farlings will general find a home anywhere psionics and strange outer planes beyond can be found. Due to the chaotic warping nature of existence beyond the orderly planes, the possibilities of what they spawn is near endless, and consequently slotting one of these strange alien wanderers in tends to be an easy fit.

They represent a more benign interaction with these planes than most creatures that hail from such twisting madness, and can make excellent vehicles of exposition about them... or perhaps not. They may only know first hand that such things are unknowable.

IRONWROUGHT

The origins of Ironwrought are many and varied. They can be the artisanal masterpiece of a Golemsmith, or perhaps a relic of a mass production of an ancient lost civilization... or perhaps not-so-lost a civilization. Their source and purpose will vary greatly. Were they made with sapience in mind, or did they gain it later? Were they made for labor or war?

Some Ironwrought will dwell on these questions and what it means for them to exist outside of the boundary of their original purpose, but many simply move on, acquiring new parameters to live their life from those they interact with, finding their purpose in life as any of their more fleshy counterparts might.

How they are treated in society will vary based on how common they are. In settings where Ironwrought created for labor are common, they will generally be treated quite neutrally, while they may be treated with greater fear or concern if Ironwrought were primarily created as war machines, though in both cases they might be mistaken for their last sapient cousins.

SELF AWARE

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
While most constructs are not truly self aware, an Ironwrought is a special case of a cosntruct that has attained a full degree of self-awareness... sometimes in a more rudimentary way, sometimes as self-aware as any human. How that occurred is often dependent on your origin. Here is a table of some origins of your self-awareness. You can roll on the following table, pick one that suits your character, or select a different reason entirely based on your game’s setting and character’s backstory.

Origin of Sapience

1	You existed without self awareness for years before a magical accident rendered you self aware.
2	You were a new experiment, designed for more complicated tasks, and ended up more sapient than expected
3	Left to a mindless task for hundreds of years in a long abandoned location, you slowly developed a sense of self until you abandoned your programmed task.
4	Your sapience is the result of the influence of a supernatural being (celestial, fey, or even fiend) granting you self-awareness for their purposes (or entertainment).
5	You awoke from a long hibernation changed, with greater self awareness. You don’t remember the past.
6	The Inventor that created you intentionally granted you full sapience, trying to build a child, friend, or adventuring companion.
7	You are the consciousness of a mortal imbued into a metal shell, transferred to a Construct to save your life.
8	You are the inventor that created yourself, transferring your consciousness to the Construct for reasons of your own.

PERSONALITY

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
The personality of Ironwrought can vary greatly as their origins can vary greatly. In some cases they are humanoids that have been bound to an Ironwrought, melancholy about their new metalbound existence. Other times they have a pragmatic nature unconcerned with the unknowable trivialities, focused on the here and now. Ironwrought most frequently have pragmatic personalities that are inclined to logical outcomes. While as a sapient creature they are capable of understanding emotion, they may not fully experience it, or not let it affect them to the degree of the more easily influenced fleshy fellows.

Adaptable Design. You can make one additional selection from your modular design trait.

Size. Your size is Medium.

Quadrupedal

Your shape has four legs and no hands. You gain the following traits.

Quadrupedal. You do not have hands. You can hold one object or grapple one thing using your mouth, but can’t speak when you do so, and any weapons held in this way are wielded with disadvantage. You can perform the somatic components of spells with one of your legs, however doing so requires 15 feet of your movement.

Size. Your size is Large

Large Variant

A variant large Ironwrought is often designed in a configuration that can serve as a mount for other creatures. Large humanoid Constructs may exist, but are not recommended for Player Creatures without dedicated large PC rules.

 • Race: Ironwrought

Fantasy Grounds Conversion Note

The three Chassis Configuration options for the Ironwrought have been coded as subraces of the Ironwrought race. When the race is selected at character creation the player will be prompted to select one of the three subraces, and the appropriate traits will be added to the character sheet.

Each of the Modular Design options has been coded as a "spell" with Ironwrought Modular Design noted as the source, and the chosen options can simply be dragged to the actions tab on the character sheet for reference.

FARLING

Farlings are a race that comes from beyond the material plane, though few are certain where. While humanoid in shape, they are immediately distinguished from mortal races. They have a slender build, large eyes, and tendrils in place of hair. Their strange nature and inherent psionic abilities make them easily feared, but they tend to be far more friendly to mortal races than most of that which comes from the beyond.

Farlings tend to be blue to purple, but can be more exotic colors, or even have strange and exotic colorations and patterns in some cases. The nature and location of their creation results in little consistency of exact appearance, though they will often have some traits of their progenitor (such as sharing an eye or skin coloration).

ADAPTABLE MIND

Farlings are exceedingly adept at picking up social cues and cultural norms, and despite their strange appearance can easily fit into a tolerant society, but often maintain exceedingly strange senses of humor and behavior, fully aware of its oddity, sometimes even playing up their alien nature. They enjoy seeing the reactions of other creatures to strange circumstances, even if they have to cause those situations.

MEMORY AND AGING

Farlings age by gaining memories. They do not biologically age, but have the ability to make permanent crystalized memories, and age roughly one day each time they do. Young Farlings make these memories a dozen times a day, aging rapidly while absorbing new information at an incredible rate, while aging Farlings become more selective in what they choose to remember. If they do not commit some memory in this way, their memory tends to be still somewhat better than a human, but they view these memories as transient things that will be eventually forgotten.

NATURE AND BIOLOGY

Farlings do not have a gender, though those that travel among other races may associate with one. They have a generally androgynous and alien apparence. They are capable of forming strong emotional bonds, though some (particularly younger ones) will find the idea of gender and the associated customs hilarious (potentially inappropriately so based on the culture). Farlings that exist for hundreds of years and absorb thousands of memories can create a new Farling by traveling to realms of mind and thought where reality is more flexible, and psionically willing a new one into existence.

A newly created Farling is often left to experience the world on their own shortly after the creation, left with associates or friends of its creator (that they have hopefully made arrangements with) who will then move on, seeking to let the new Farling develop on its own, often seeking to not influence their experiences more than necessary.

Taking care of a young Farling can be exhausting due to the rampant curiosity and inquisitive nature rapidly consuming new experiences and memories, but their inquisitive nature causes them to age exceedingly quickly. A young Farling can fully absorb many memories a day, aging exceedingly fast. It is usually not long before they seek to wander broader environments, and set out into the world.

Farlings are not aquatic, but are unusually suited to it, often finding water quite comfortable and are natural swimmers.

Dark Reflection 
Some Farlings become addicted to acquiring memories, and particularly savor those from other creatures. While a player character can only absorb memories from a willing creature, some stories tell of Farlings that have fallen into evil ways, ripping and devouring the memories from mortal creatures compulsively devouring their memories until nothing is left, savoring the exotic memories they discover.

FARLING NAMES

Farling don’t have traditional names, identifying each other through psionic projections of certain thought patterns. Those that interact with members of other races will adopt an assumed name, running the gambit from common and boring to outlandish and absurd. Their name often reflects the culture they most interacted with when finding they needed a name that could be made with sounds.

They rarely place great importance in their name, occasionally changing it or accepting a new nickname without much thought, as they don’t particularly associate the name with themselves; to them, that’s merely what people call them.

Farling Names: Blue, Dustin, Jonny, Lulu, Newbie, Pattern, Purple, Rey, Sala, Stripes, Squid, Thomas, Uanqor, Quentin, Yara, Yldel, Wis.

Completely Random

If it seems like these names are random, it is because they are. There is no pattern to Farling names beyond the nature of creatures naming them, sometimes being simply descriptive.
### Layout: end frame

TRAITS

As a farling, your character has the following traits.

Ability Score Increase. Your Intelligence score, Wisdom score, and Charisma score all increase by 1.

Age. A Farling ages by absorbing memories. Each time they permanently absorb a memory, they age roughly one day. A young Farling can absorb dozens of memories a day, aging rapidly. Once reaching adulthood (a process that often only takes a decade), the rate at which they can absorb memories begins to slow, they become more selective, aging far slower.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Old Age

If a Farling can die of old age is unknown. They become far more selective about absorbing memories as they grow older, often losing their curious nature and becoming withdrawn from society after absorbing thousands of memories, ruminating on what they have experienced.

### Layout: end frame

Alignment. Farlings show little consistency in alignment, and are shaped by their circumstances and background. Their curious and impulsive nature often leads younger members of the race to exhibit chaotic tendencies.

Size. Most Farlings stand between 5 and 6 feet tall, with a slighter build than humans. Your size is Medium.

Aberration. Your creature type is Aberration, rather than humanoid.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet. You have a swimming speed of 20 feet.

Languages. You can speak, read, and write Common, Deep Speech, and one extra language of your choice.

Adaptive Intuition. You gain proficiency in Insight, and have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks to determine social cues or cultural customs.

Psionic Mind. You gain the Telepathy Discipline of the psion, though you can’t use the Alternate Effects unless you gain this Discipline from another source. If you gain this Discipline from another source, you gain 1 additional psi point instead.

Crystalized Memory. When you learn or experience something, you can fix that memory, making it a permanent memory you can always remember with crystal clarity. This memory can be anything that occurs within a 1 hour span (it can be as short as a fleeting sensation, or as long as 1 hour of events).

Once you do this, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. Absorbing these memories is how a Farling ages, and you age one day for each memory you absorb in this way. You can absorb a memory from a willing creature via your telepathy in this way.

Broad Horizons. You have resistance to psychic damage. Once per day, if take psychic damage from a critical hit, you can choose to absorb that damage as a memory, taking no damage.

Skill Absorption. Your rapid ability to learn new skills grants you proficiency in one artisan tool and one skill of your choice. At your GM’s discretion, if your game allows for the training in tools and skills, you may gain proficiency in them twice as fast using your Crystalized Memory feature daily.

VARIANT FARLING

At the discrection of your GM, the following is an intended feature of Farlings that can be added in place of Skill Absorption. This is a recommended feature to allow additional options, but may not be suited for all games due to interacterations with other custom rules at some tables:

Alien Mind. When you gain the Spellcasting or Psionics ability from any class or feature, you can change the associated ability score to your choice of Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. Any time that class references the previous spell casting ability, you can replace it with your selected score (for example, if you are playing a Psion and change its associated ability score to Charisma, Empowered Psiosnics would add Charisma instead of Intelligence).

Alien Possibilities

This feature is very unique. It means that Farlings can play classes in new ways, and multiclass in ways that would not normally work, opening unique doors and possibilities that other races cannot share.

If combining these rules with ones that allow for the relocation of ability scores, one should be careful to not unlock an option that may be unexpectedly potent. Work with your GM when combining homebrew and variant rules.

 • Race: Farling

Fantasy Grounds Conversion Note

The base Farling and the Variant Farling are coded into FG as subraces of the Farling. When this race is selected at character creation the player will be prompted to select either 'Farling' or 'Variant Farling' as their subrace. Selecting Farling gives the character the Skill Absorption trait, while selecting Variant Farling gives the character the Alien Possibilities trait. This is the only difference between the subraces.

TEMPLATES

The following are templates that can be placed over any race. These are not races, rather members of other races that have been defined by modifications that have been made to them. These templates can be treated as a modifier of a racial option. For example, one might refer to an elf using this template as an “augmented elf.” Though they superficially inherent the appearance of another race, all mechanical benefits of that race are replaced by the following properties.

Consequently, you qualify for any feat or other requirement that applies to the base selected race, but all other bonuses are replaced by the listed bonuses for the class.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

AUGMENTED

The augmented are creatures that have replaced parts of the body with mechanical and magical parts—some sort of an arcane cyborg. The origin of these parts is many and varied, as is their nature: anything from living magic to mechanical means is possible, based on the setting and character. These provide bonuses that replace or augment the default features of your race selection.

WARPED

The warped are members of races that have been deeply influenced by the powers from beyond, twisting their mind and body with mysterious power that has left them fundamentally changed.

 • Warped

### Layout: end frame

Fantasy Grounds Conversion Note

Augmented and Warped function as full races as far as FG is concerned. Short of creating an individual subrace for every potential combination of Augmented or Warped, there is no way to apply one of these "templates" over another race. The simplest way to make use of these races is to apply them as the character's race upon creation. Then drag the size, languages, and any other needed Traits from the 'Other' tab of the original race.

AUGMENTED

The augmented are creatures that have replaced parts of the body with mechanical and magical parts—some sort of an arcane cyborg. The origin of these parts is many and varied, as is their nature: anything from living magic to mechanical means is possible, based on the setting and character. These provide bonuses that replace or augment the default features of your race selection.

INTENTIONALLY CREATED

Almost all augmented are intentionally created—not always by the intentions of the individual, but almost always by the intention of someone. This often leaves open the question of why, and for what purpose.

Many of them are created for war, some as bizare experiments, some to restore missing pieces, sometimes they had a choice in the process, and some will insist that they never asked for it.

TRAITS

As an augmented, the following traits replace any traits that your race would normally grant you:

Modified Origin. Select an existing race option. You gain the creature type, size, and languages of that race.

Ability Score Increase. Your Constitution score increases by 1, and one ability score of your choice increases by 1.

Alignment. An augmented creature can be any alignment, but have a inclination toward lawful alignments.

Speed. Your base walking speed is 30 feet.

Inherited Abilities. You can keep the following elements of that race: any skill proficiencies you gained from it and any climbing, flying, or swimming speed you gained from it. Alternatively, you can forgo this to select two Augmented Abilities (below).

AUGMENTED ABILITIES

On top of your inherited abilities, you have been augmented with one of the following, granting you special new abilities:

 • Arcane Arm. Your arm is replaced by a mechanical or magical replacement. Your Strength score increases by 1, and it can serve as a natural weapon. It deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage on a hit, and counts as a simple weapon with the light property.
 • Arcane Eye. Your eye (one or both) are replaced by mechanical or magical replacements. You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness as shades of gray, and gain proficiency in the Perception skill. You can cast the detect magic spell, and once you reach 5th level, the see invisible spell with this eye. Casting them in this way requires no material components. Once you cast either of these spells with this trait, you can’t cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using any spell slots you have.
 • Arcane Heart. Your heart (or equivalent organ) is replaced by a mechanical or magical replacement. Your Constitution score increases by 1, and whenever you roll Hit Dice, you gain temporary hit points equal to the number of Hit Dice expended.
 • Arcane Mind. Your mind is enhanced by mechanical or magical minds. Your Intelligence score increases by 1, and you gain advantage on any Intelligence check to recall information you’ve seen before, solve mathematical equations, detect patterns, or break ciphers and codes.

 • Race: Augmented

Fantasy Grounds Conversion Note

Augmented presented unique coding challenges to make this dynamic racial template work within the confines of FG. Each of the four Augmented Abilities above is coded as a subrace, and one will be selected at character creation. If the Augmented character chooses to forgo their Inheritied Abilities Trait then simply drag the Traits from the additional two Augmented Abilities subraces to the character sheet.

WARPED

The warped are members of races that have been deeply influenced by the powers from beyond, twisting their mind and body with mysterious power that has left them fundamentally changed.

TWISTED ORIGIN

Most often this comes from long exposure, sometimes only manifesting in creatures born under its influence, but there are those that have been warped later in life, generally by more direct interactions with the creatures that lurk beyond the veil of sanity.

Many of the warped fall to madness, unable to escape the whispering voices and strange visions, but ones that become adventurers have managed to learn to live with their condition, and consequently have minds of steel.

Inner Voice. You have an inner voice that doesn’t belong to you, frequently muttering nonsense, but occasionally offering useful advice, letting you add 1d6 to any ability check you make. You can do this a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all uses at the end of a long rest.

WARPED GIFT.

Your condition grants you one special trait. Some may view it as a curse or burden, but you’ve adapted to using it to your advantage. Select one of the following options:

 • Warped Eyes. You see the world in a different way. You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks against living creatures, and disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks against non-living things (such as traps or details in your environment).
 • Warped Limb. One of your limbs is abnormally long and flexible. Any weapon wielded in that hand gains the reach property.
 • Warped Mind. Your mind is a foreign and alien place compared to other humanoids.

Creatures can telepathically communicate with you only if you allow it.
 • Warped Skin. Your skin is a rough mottled hide. You have resistance to acid damage.

Each of the Warped Gifts has been coded as a Warped subrace. The player will be promted to select a gift at character creation, and the appropirate traits will be added to the character sheet.

FEATS

ADEPT POISONER

You specialize in developing poisons, granting you proficiency with poisoner’s kits and the following benefits:

 • When you create a poison, you can specify a creature type that poison is specifically made for. That poison ignores resistance and immunity to poison damage for that creature.
 • You can apply poison to a weapon or piece of ammunition as a bonus action, instead of an action.
 • During a long rest, you can perform 1 hour of work using a poisoner’s kit to create a number of doses of potent poison equal to your proficiency bonus, which last until you apply them to a weapon or finish your next long rest. Once applied to a weapon or piece of ammunition, the poison retains its potency for 1 minute or until you hit with the weapon or ammunition. When a creature takes damage from the coated weapon or ammunition, that creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC equal to 8 + twice your proficiency bonus) or take 1d8 poison damage and become poisoned until the end of your next turn. On success, they take half as much damage and aren’t poisoned.

When you use this feature to create poison, you can expend 15 gp per dose of poison to create a more deadly poison. When you do so, creatures that fail their Constitution saving throw against it take an extra 1d8 poison damage.

This becomes a new way to enchant permanent magic items for you, allowing you to replace an essence in a crafting check with part of your soul. When you do so, you can replace one essence of a varying rarity (depending on your level, as per the table below) with your soul, and gain advantage on crafting checks to make that item, the item becomes attunement if it was not already, and becomes attuned to you on completion.

XXX
d4	Effect
1	The target foresees an action to come. Roll a d20 and record the value. Until the duration of the spell ends, they can replace one of their d20 rolls with the value rolled.
2	The target sees their own death. If they are reduced to zero hit points by an attack or failing a save throw during the duration, they instead evade the attack or pass the saving throw if they are not otherwise incapacitated prior to being reduced to zero.
3	They see a future victory, growing confident. They gain 10 temporary hit points and are immune to the frightened condition for the duration of the spell.
4	The target sees an ambush or surprise, the first time they would be surprised they are not, or the first time an attack would be made against them with advantage, it is instead made with disadvantage.

Once any of the events foreseen occur, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When cast using 3 or more psi points, you can select the effect instead of rolling a d4.

The Unavoidable Death
In the case of number 2, passing the save will not always be enough to make them not be reduced to zero hit points. Sometimes they are reduced to zero by something like falling damage that has no save or attack. Sometimes life's a bummer that way.

Chapter 5: Monsters

NPCS

The following are templates for psion and inventor NPCs (Non-Player Characters). You can build NPCs using the Player Character rules, or you can use these templates for a quick and combat-ready version. Their abilities as presented here are streamlined to generally only the most relevant features, but you can add any abilities from the class mechanics that you see fit for that character or their usage in your story.

The versions presented here tend to present a psion with only one psionic discipline for simplicity. It is likely many NPC psions simply only have one discipline, or you can add abilities from other templates to represent a mix-and-match.

Monster Statblock vs PC Character

Sheet Some GMs always use simplified monster statblocks for NPCs, and that is definitely an option. Personally as a GM, I use monster statblocks for enemies and temporary allies, eventually converting them to PC-style stat blocks if they will be present for a long time or controlled by players.

MONSTER SECTION

The following is a list of new monsters and NPCs. These are designed to fit a variety of roles and provide a diverse cast of new threats to challenge your players, but also to tie into the content and themes of the book.

Some of these monsters are designed to be solo encounters. These monsters present a significant and multifaceted fight for their CR.

SOLO THREATS (BY CR)

 • Adaptive Slime (CR 5)
 • Lurking Maw (CR 9)
 • Unearthed Destroyer (CR 13)
 • Ascendant Master (CR 16)
 • Clockwork Drake (CR 16)
 • Ancient Sentinel (CR 19)

The rest of the monsters are intended to be encounter building tools. Some have easy combinations: for example, a Silver Guardian (CR 9), a handful of Silver Soldiers (CR 6), and a few Silver Sentries (CR 1) will build a challenging, dynamic, and thematic encounter, and can each stand on their own as a minor threat—just probably not a campaign “BBEG” encounter. Likewise, the Uncaged monsters or the whole writhing mass of eldritch horrors are designed to naturally work together in fun (and challenging) ways.

Other instances provide simple, flexible tools that can be dropped into encounters. I particularly wanted to flesh out the roster of easy-to-use NPCs.

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

These monsters are built to the CR specifications of the base game, but should generally be expected to punch slightly above their CR. This is because each monster tends to be designed with some degree of synergy inside its own skills that is not well represented by CR.

While the solo monsters (listed above) endeavor to provide a handful of unique challenges across the fight, all the monsters aim to bring at least one memorable encounter to bear.

CLASS ABILITIES & PSIONICS

The class abilities and psionics that appear in the monsters are simplified for convenience. Monsters use recharge mechanics rather than psi points, for example. This is merely to make running monsters easier. If you prefer to use psi points and more integrated class mechanics, you can generally treat a monster with psionics as a psion of a level equal to its CR, and with psi points to match. This will make monsters stronger than intended, but not by a large margin.

ANCIENT SENTINEL

Legend speaks of ancient constructs built to hold back a terrible calamity of untold horrors from beyond. Posted as eternal guards over ancient lost portals, these construct sentinels were thought to be immune to whispers of madness that seeped through—a theory that has proved tragically misguided. Now twisted by the forces beyond, the sentinels have warped into eldritch engines of destruction, completely mad and not truly aware of their own actions.

Awakening from ancient, forgotten sites, often long-lost vaults and shrines, these can appear without warning and wreak terrible destruction in a maddened rampage. These sentinels are massive creatures from an ancient era, towering 30 feet tall, and crushing anything built to a human scale with ease.

DEPLOYMENT

The ancient sentinel is intended primarily as a solo encounter, and particularly excels as an event. A rampaging, gigantic mechanical elephant is most dramatic when it has plenty of buildings—and maybe some villagers—to trample, and for the players to save. It is a siege monster that is exceptionally good at engaging many targets simultaneously. It can even enter a campaign a little earlier than its CR might suggest as a set piece encounter where the PCs are rallying a defense against it.

If you do need some more chaos, you can have the ancient sentinel be the harbinger to a wave of psionic monsters that have broken through in its wake. Its immunity to psychic damage means it is largely unfazed by many of their effects, making this a devastating pairing.

SIMPLE SCRIPT

Here’s a simple script that you can follow to get an effective use from an ancient sentinel:

 • The sentinel should always move when able, ideally trampling any smaller creatures in its path and smashing buildings if possible. Move for maximum destruction unless it has a specific objective.
 • Move towards something that can be smashed.
 • During the advance, unleash a Bladed Trunk attack, moving the target into or out of its path.
 • Move through a target using Trampling Advance.
 • If it knocks a target prone or is moving through its last target, use its stomp attack.
 • Lastly, it should lash out with its tentacles against any target that is attacking it, either grabbing the attackers or flinging things at them.
 • If a target is bothering it with ranged attacks, it can fling creatures or objects it is grappling at the target.

CONSIDERATIONS

While the sentinel lacks ranged abilities, it can use Fling as a ranged offensive tool quite effectively, if needed, simply by picking up objects and throwing them. While its speed isn’t particularly high, its Unstoppable Advance trait and Unstoppable Trample legendary action mean its effective movement can be quite substantial.

The sentinel may not care about the party at all. If they are insufficiently powerful to stop it, it may simply rampage through a city before wandering off to rampage elsewhere. Only if players prove a danger to it will it focus on them. While a very challenging monster, the dynamic nature of the fight will come from what the sentinel is destroying.

Traits
Immutable Form. The sentinel is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the sentinel fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Magic Resistance. The sentinel has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Scale Immunity. The sentinel has resistance to the damage of any spell that doesn't target an area of effect, and it suffers no other conditions or effects from them.
Siege Monster. The sentinel deals double damage to objects and structures.
Trampling Advance. Any Large or smaller creature in a space the sentinel passes through must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take 13 (2d12) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone.
Unstoppable Advance. The sentinel's advance cannot be stopped. If the sentinel's speed would be reduced to zero, it is reduced to half its speed instead. Any obstacle or building that would stop its advance takes 39 (6d12) bludgeoning damage. The sentinel treats magical barriers that would stop its movement as difficult terrain.
Whispering Madness. The sentinel is steeped in eldritch madness. If a creature starts its turn within 5 feet of the sentinel or while grappled by it, the creature must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or take 10 (3d6) psychic damage and roll a d4, suffering an additional condition until the start of its next turn, as noted in the following table.
	4pt
	tabularc l

		d4 & Condition 

		1-2 & Frightened 
		3 & Blinded 
		4 & Paralyzed 

	tabular
Eruption of Corruption. If the sentinel is bloodied (reduced to less than half of its maximum hit points), it unleashes a psionic blast immediately (no action required), violently discharging the eldritch corruption within it. All creatures within 60 feet of it must make a DC 16 Intelligence saving throw. On failed save, a creature takes 21 (6d6) psychic damage and becomes stunned until the end of its next turn. On successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't stunned. The range of Whispering Madness then increases to 60 feet until the sentinel dies or recovers hit points above half its maximum.

Actions
Multiattack. The sentinel makes a bladed trunk attack, a stomp attack, and two tentacle attacks. It can replace each tentacle attack with one use of Fling.
Bladed Trunk. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (3d12 + 8) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 22 Strength saving throw or be pushed up to 10 feet in a direction of the sentinel's choice.
Stomp. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (3d12 + 8) bludgeoning damage.
Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The sentinel has four tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.
Fling. One Large or smaller object held or creature grappled by the sentinel is thrown up to 60 feet in a direction of the sentinel's choice and knocked prone. If a thrown target strikes a solid surface, the target takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be knocked prone.

Legendary Actions
The sentinel can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The sentinel regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
Tentacle Attack or Fling. The sentinel makes one tentacle attack or uses its Fling.
Unstoppable Trample. The sentinel moves up to half its speed. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.

CLOCKWORK DRAKE

Clockwork drakes, sometimes improperly called clockwork dragons (or informally called “metal danger birbs”), are flying, metal constructs of intricate machinery and magic. Most often created by wizards or inventors, they have a distrust of other magic users, and the ability to nullify magic through blasts of their own power. Typically serving as guardians, seekers, or shock troops, many that exist now have long since outlived the creators that developed their esoteric behavior.

SIMPLE SCRIPT

This is a simple script to run a clockwork drake on:

 • If the drake can target 2 or more creatures with its breath weapon, it will use its breath weapon and then fly up 40 feet from the ground, if possible.
 • Between its turns, the drake will use its Arc legendary action if more than one creature is within range, and then its Wing Attack to position closer to a target that has drawn its ire.
 • If the drake’s breath weapon doesn’t recharge at the start of its turn, it will use its movement to descend, use its Crushing Stomp to grapple a target, and lash out with its tail.
 • The drake will use its Wing Attack to take to the air, its tail to attack the grappled target, and then drop that target when it perceives that such a fall would take the target out of the fight.
 • If the drake can use no other action, it will attempt its Arcane Nullification against any harmful magical effect.

TACTICS

The clockwork drake is in many ways a variant of a dragon fight. It has high mobility, dangerous area of effect capabilities, and relies on its flight to get into the air and move around. The clockwork drake is an enemy of moderate intelligence and will generally attack creatures based on their perceived or demonstrated threat to it if it doesn’t have an objective target.

Clockwork drakes favor open areas and will generally avoid a fight in enclosed spaces without room to fly around unless forced to fight in such conditions by their objective or purpose.

CONSIDERATIONS

A clockwork drake will pose a very large kill risk to players when deployed in such a fashion. The party’s main goal will be to kill it as fast as possible; otherwise, they will likely succumb to its brutal skill set. Don’t try to keep it alive longer than its shelf life, or it will likely succeed in defeating the players.

To increase the drake’s effectiveness, target ranged characters with its smash, grab, and drop combo. Not only will this eliminate the greatest threats, but the targets will also be most likely to fail the save and least able to operate effectively in the clockwork drake’s grasp.

DEPLOYMENT

A clockwork drake can serve as a solo encounter—providing a dangerous, high-stakes fight—but it will wither under heavy, direct fire. It can benefit from some supporting, lower-damage threats to absorb some incoming damage and distract its foes, but it’s extremely deadly when paired with other high-damage combatants. These drakes are best paired with a wizard or golemsmith that can give the fight some dynamic elements.

TRAITS

Adamantine Weapons. The drake's weapon attacks are adamantine.

Crushing Descent. If the drake flies at least 20 feet downward and then hits a target with a Crushing Stomp attack, the target takes an extra 6 (1d12) bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and grappled by the drake (escape DC 17). Until the grapple ends, the target is restrained and has disadvantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and the drake can't use the same claw on another target.

Immutable Form. The drake is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

Legendary Resistance (3/Day). If the drake fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Lightning Powered. If the drake takes at least 10 lightning damage from any source, it regains 1 spent legendary action.

BLOODIED

Overcharged. If the drake is bloodied (reduced to less than half of its hit points), it starts to crackle with arcs of lightning. Its Flaming Tar Breath automatically recharges, and any creature that hits it with a melee attack before the start of its next turn (including the attack that bloodied it, if applicable) takes 6 (1d12) lightning damage.
### Layout: end frame

ACTIONS

Multiattack. The drake makes two attacks: one with its bladed tail and one with its crushing stomp.

Bladed Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d8 + 7) slashing damage.

Crushing Stomp. Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or smaller target. Hit: 13 (1d12 + 7) bludgeoning damage.

Arcane Nullification. The drake ends one spell effect within 30 feet of it. If the spell is of 6th level or higher, the drake must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 + the level of the spell) to end it.

Flaming Tar Breath (Recharge 5–6). The drake unleashes a blast of flaming tar in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in the area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (13d6) fire damage and becomes covered in a thick layer of flaming tar. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t covered in tar. While a creature is covered in tar, its speed is halved and it takes 10 (3d6) fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can spend an action clearing the flaming tar from itself or another creature within 5 feet of it.

REACTIONS

Windy Flapping. The drake adds 5 to its AC against one ranged weapon attack that would hit it. To do so, the dragon must see the attacker and be flying.

LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The drake can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The drake regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Arc. All creatures within 60 feet of the drake take 2 (1d4) lightning damage. Once the drake uses Arc, it can’t use it again until the start of its next turn.

Tail Attack. The drake makes a bladed tail attack.

Wind Up. The drakeconserves energy to unleash in a burst. It gains 10 temporary hit points, and it can take the Dash action as a bonus action on its next turn.

Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions). The drake beats its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the drake must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take 14 (2d6 + 7) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The drake can then fly up to half its flying speed.

UNEARTHED DESTROYER

Few know the origin or purpose of these engines of destruction, only the path of carnage left behind whenever one is unearthed from its ancient resting place. Were these forged as terrifying siege weapons, or are they some form of guardian bereft of purpose and understanding? Whatever their origin, these constructs now serve as a potent warning for anyone who would dare delve too deeply into ancient, ruined history. The journey of many an adventuring group has ended when they unearth one of these ancient destroyers.

DEPLOYMENT

These destroyers most often serve as a dangerous solo encounter, found deep in an ancient ruin best left undisturbed—though perhaps an adventuring group encounters one previously unearthed mid-rampage.

They are best fit as a potent campaign foe for a Tier 2 group as they approach 10th level, or as a dangerous obstacle for a group in early Tier 3.

They can also serve as a potent lieutenant (or pet) of a higher-level villain in Tier 4, though their damage and disruption mean they will generally remain too potent to be a minion-level threat.

ANCIENT AND DECAYING

These constructs are terrible engines of destruction but are remnants of another era that are barely intact. They are unstable and prone to explosions and devastating ends, wreaking one last burst of carnage on their way out.

SIMPLE SCRIPT

Here’s a simple script that you can follow to get an effective use from an unearthed destroyer.

 • Use Gravity Surge to increase gravity.
 • Move toward the closest target.
 • Cast lightning bolt if it can hit multiple targets or electrocute if it can’t.
 • Bite a target, if possible.
 • Use tail attacks to batter targets in range or cast crackle if no targets are in range. Use lightning charged if no good targets are available.
 • Use Gravity Surge to lower gravity. Cycle raising and lowering gravity, unless there is a flying target, in which case increase the gravity to ground it. The destroyer does not like flying creatures.
 • Only use Annihilation Blast if the destroyer is trapped by magic or its target is defended by magic that would otherwise impede chomping it.
 • Repeat steps.

The destroyer is not stupid, but it is simple. It destroys, consuming creatures and turning them to ash. It doesn’t fear destruction, and it particularly dislikes things that attempt to control it or impede it.

CONSIDERATIONS

While a relatively straightforward monster, these creatures are significantly more fatal than they might seem at first glance. Allow a PCs to gather some information about them: an Arcana check of DC 10 or higher might tell the players that the power core looks unstable, and a result of 15 or higher might tell them that any creature that is devoured by the destroyer would be turned to ash. At DC 20 the irreversible nature its Meltdown may be revealed.

TRAITS

Death Burst. When the destroyer is reduced to 0 hit points, its power containment fails, unleashing massive destructive power. All creatures within 120 of it must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This damage is halved for creatures that are more than 60 feet away from the destroyer.

Gravity Surge. As a bonus action at the start of its turn, the destroyer can raise or lower gravity. If it raises gravity, all other creatures within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or fall prone. A flying creature that fails this save falls to the ground even if it has the ability to hover or is being held aloft by magic. If the destroyer lowers gravity, all other creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving or float 10 feet upwards (as if by the levitate spell) until the start of the destroyer's next turn.

Innate Spellcasting. The destroyer's innate spellcasting ability is Constitution (spell save DC 19). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:

At will: crackle*, fling*, lightning charged* 
3/day each: electrocute*, jumping jolt*, lightning bolt

Unstable Trajectories. If the destroyer has used its Gravity Surge since the start of its last turn, all ranged weapon attacks originating more than 30 feet away from the destroyer that pass within 30 feet of the destroyer are made with disadvantage.

Weak Point. When a creature within 10 feet of the destroyer makes an attack against it, the creature can target its power core. On a hit, the attack deals an extra 4 (1d8) damage to the destroyer, and the attacker takes 4 (1d8) lightning damage from the backlash.

BLOODIED

Meltdown. When the destroyer becomes bloodied (reduced to less than half of its maximum hit points), it becomes too damaged to contain its massive power core. At the start of each of its turns, it and all creatures within 60 feet of it must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This is a runaway process that can't be stopped once started. The third time this would occur, the destroyer is instead reduced to 0 hit points, triggering its Death Burst.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

ACTIONS

Multiattack. The destroyer makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its tail. It can use its Swallow instead of its bite, and it can cast a spell in place of either attack.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 27 (3d12 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it is grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the destroyer can't bite another target.

Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage. It can't target a creature grappled by its bite with this attack.

Annihilation Blast. The destroyer unleashes a blast of power in a 30-feet cone. Any spell of 7th level or lower in the area ends, and each creature in the area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 27 (6d8) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Structures automatically take maximum damage from this effect.

Swallow. The destroyer makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller creature it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the destroyer, and it takes 22 (5d8) lightning damage at the start of each of the destroyer's turns. If this damage kills the target, it is reduced to fine ash.

If the destroyer takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the destroyer must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the destroyer. If the destroyer dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.

LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The destroyer can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The destroyer regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Lightning Power. The destroyer casts one of its at will spells.

Move. The destroyer moves up to half its speed.

Tail Attack. The destroyer makes one tail attack.

SILVER RELICS

These monsters are a set of minor foes that are relics of a long-lost time... perhaps simply misplaced by a distant civilization. They are advanced constructs with a relatively basic purpose and abilities, but they are highly effective at those simple roles.

SILVER STALKER

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Sleek, seek-and-destroy units, silver stalkers are a piece of lost technology that adventurers are more likely to encounter. Single minded and dogmatic with an eternal drive, they have a relatively simple and specialized intelligence that entirely revolves around their purpose. They can be intelligent in their ability to track and navigate, but they will rarely apply advanced reasoning.

TACTICS

In combat, silver stalkers will generally employ their heat ray (if they aren't currently frying a target with it), and then move to attack a target that looks like it will be a threat to them. If they are defending a location, they will focus on the first person to enter; if they are hunting a target, they will lock onto it with unreasonable dedication. If they detect a magical or adamantine weapon, they will frequently target that with their heat ray first, trying to eliminate it as a threat. They never consider self-preservation, unless it helps them accomplish their objective.

USAGE

Stalkers can be deployed in a wide range of circumstances and are often the first hint that there is something strange afoot, as they can range further abroad. Created by mages, advanced societies, or parts of ancient tech, these silver relics are an uncommon foe, but one that poses a significant threat early on, and remain a relevant threat throughout the game as a minion due to their high hit chance and the guaranteed damage of their heat ray. Their excessive Stealth, Survival, and Perception make them a useful tool throughout the game, as they are difficult to evade, even with magic.

 • At levels 1-4, a stalker is a solid solo threat that will pose a difficult and dangerous challenge to a party.
 • At levels 5-10, it is no longer a solo threat, but can be a relevant and dangerous facet of an encounter. It is capable of significant damage but will likely die rapidly and should be deployed in numbers.
 • At levels 11-17+, a stalker's impact is relevant but minor. Due to its heat ray and high hit chance, it will remain a threat that has to be dealt with, even if its damage and hit points render it more of a nuisance than a true threat. Its high Dexterity means it has a better chance of surviving area of effect abilities than many lower-level threats.

Small, floating contraptions, an unwary observer might deem these tiny, insect-like things a minor threat, but they can prove to be a vexing foe. Most notable for their excellent perceptive capabilities and ability to highlight targets for their allies, they rarely pose a significant threat by themselves, but a wise adventurer is cautious of these sentries in the presence of harder-hitting foes.

Most often deployed as sentinels or force multipliers of more powerful foes, these constructs are capable of limited adaptation in their plans, but are dogmatic in their devotion to a purpose, not generally being truly sentient despite their high capacity for reasoning.

TACTICS

Silver sentries often have a primary directive, and when engaging in violent response will do so as efficiently as possible to execute their directive. They are capable of adaptive planning, but they won’t deviate from their task, even in the face of certain destruction.

USAGE

Silver sentries can be deployed as a threat against a low-level group to guard a location of importance, but they are most often deployed as potent support minions for a higher-level, advanced construct threat.

 • At levels 1–4, these are a minor solo threat. They can pose a small challenge to a party due to their all-around hit statistics (high AC, high attack bonus, and damage resistance), but their inability to do large amounts of damage will generally make them not a deadly threat.
 • At levels 5–17+, they remain a significant minion due to the Targeting Lock ability. They will always be an enemy that players will be encouraged to focus down and eliminate first, and they are a thorn in the side of stealthy operations.

SILVER SOLDIER

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Golems that few would recognize as such—somewhere between a human and a skeleton, slender and sleek—silver soldiers exhibit swift, smooth movements.

They were likely once common foot soldiers in a time and place long forgotten. Any remaining units find themselves deadly weapons in an age unprepared for them.

TACTICS

Silver soldiers are most effective at a distance and will attempt to engage from range. Even at close range they will often use their ranged attack, relying on their excessively high attack bonus. They can determine the AC of creatures and will use this knowledge to pick their targets efficiently.

USAGE

With a high damage output, they make excellent ranged threats at higher levels, or can be a challenge to overcome in specialized situations where they have cover and positioning.

 • At levels 1–4, silver soldiers are exceedingly dangerous. Their damage is very high, and they have few weaknesses to exploit.
 • At levels 5–10, they are a significant, high-damage threat. They serve as artillery that need to be dealt with but will be somewhat fragile as a solo encounter.
 • At levels 11+, they still make excellent artillery threats that must be respected. Their long range and high attack bonus mean they will remain a significant threat.

SILVER GUARDIAN

Larger, more advanced, and more dangerous than other silver relics, these appear as hulking brutes, but have a keen intellect and the ability to manipulate gravity. They may either lead other silver relic golems or serve as a standalone threat.

TACTICS

Silver guardians excel in durability and control and will engage and contain the most dangerous threats. While highly intelligent, their intelligence is a robotic logic that can be fooled by player characters behaving in irregular ways.

USAGE

They tend to serve as mid- to high-level threats, rarely taking a minion role. They can, however, make an excellent companion for a squishier threat.

 • At levels 1–4, this would be an insurmountable solo threat.
 • At levels 5–10, they serve as a moderate solo threat, or an excellent duologist or leader of a tough encounter.
 • At level 11+, they will no longer be a substantial solo threat, but can make a great bruiser or controller.

BLOODIED

Destabilized Gravity Generator. When the guardian is bloodied (reduced to less than half its maximum hit points), it immediately unleashes a blast of gravity. All creatures within 30 feet of it must make a DC 22 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed 30 feet away from the guardian. If the saving throw fails by 5 more, the creature is also thrown 30 feet into the air. Until the guardian finishes a long rest, it loses its Forcefield Projector trait, but it can target up to 3 creatures with its Manipulate Gravity.

ACTIONS

Multiattack. The guardian uses Manipulate Gravity. It then casts a spell or makes two attacks.

Grab. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained.

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage.

Manipulate Gravity. The guardian forces one creature within 60 feet of it to make a DC 22 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the guardian can move the target up to 30 feet in any direction. The target lands prone and takes 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage, unless it was thrown straight up, in which case it takes falling damage as normal, if applicable.

LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The guardian can take 2 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The guardian regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Calculate. The guardian chooses a number between 1 and 20. Once before the end of its next turn, when a creature it can see would make an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, the guardian can make the creature use the chosen number, instead of rolling.

Slam Attack. The guardian makes one slam attack

IRONWROUGHT

Collectively known as the Ironwrought, these are a series of adaptable humanoid constructs. Their sources and abilities are many and varied. There are even reports of fully sapient members of the categorization, with some adapting to the adventuring lifestyle (see Races section).

The ones presented here are simple versions that might be encountered. Ironwrought constructs tend to be viewed as the creations of societies more magically included and less technologically advanced than Silver Relics, though some evidence suggests of great wars fought between them.

LURKING MAW

A lurking maw is no natural creature, having slithered out of twisted realms of nightmare beyond the veil of mortal comprehension. They do not need to eat to survive and can live indefinitely lurking in darkness, but possess great hunger, devouring all they encounter.

They despise light and life and will seek to destroy either that enters the darkness of their lair. They cannot be drawn out into sunlight or from their lair by almost any means.

DEPLOYMENT

A lurking maw makes a great solo boss encounter for the bottom of a dungeon or forbidden area. It can be an eldritch evil to guard what the heroes must retrieve, the ancient scar of some ill-advised magic or portal, or the lurking nightmare of a forgotten lab or wizard's abode.

It can serve as the capstone for a 5th-level party as a known factor they will have to confront, or as a nasty surprise for a higher-level party, becoming a lesser threat beyond 11th level.

TACTICS

There are two important factors when combating a lurking maw: light and mobility. Parties without a way to keep the battlefield illuminated will find themselves in great danger, as even darkvision begins to fail with the multiple instances of magical darkness the lurking maw can produce.

The second factor is trying to avoid a creature being consumed, leaving no room for picking them back up. The lurking maw is most deadly when emphasizing these hurdles-by targeting light sources and devouring those that try to make light in its presence, particularly loathsome sources of sunlight.

SIMPLE SCRIPT

Here's a simple script to get the most from a lurking maw. You can use this as a guide when running one:

 • The lurking maw will attempt to ambush an unaware party, though it is unlikely to succeed against a cautious party.
 • It will open with Expunge Light, removing the brightest light source it can or a light source that will plunge the most of its targets into darkness.
 • With many targets available, it will attempt to grapple three of them: one in each tentacle, and one in its maw.
 • Note that while each tentacle can only grapple one target, the lurking maw can still attack a single creature that is isolated against it with multiple tentacles or its bite.
 • As a lair action, it will use Inky Pool to create darkness if there isn't already suitable darkness, or it will use Grasping Darkness to spawn a new maw tendril if suitable darkness is already present.
 • It will use its legendary action as soon as possible to use Mind Terrors, targeting any creature it doesn't have grappled first in priority.
 • While it is waiting for that to recharge, it will use Crush if any target is grappled, or Tentacle Attack if it has no target grappled.

CONSIDERATIONS

The first time a party encounters a lurking maw, be generous with the hints they are going to need. A party with weak light sources will very likely meet their end if they are unprepared, and the lurking maw can even punch above its weight class. Conversely, it lacks durability when heavily exposed to light, losing many of its features and defensive layers.

TRAITS

Consuming Hunger. If a creature swallowed by the lurking maw dies, the lurking maw is psionically nourished, regaining 13 (2d12) hit points and either one legendary resistance or one legendary action (its choice).

Expunge Light. At the start of its turn, the lurking maw can extinguish one light source within 120 feet of it (no action required). A lightgenerating spell cast with a spell slot of 3rd level or higher can’t be extinguished in this way.

Legendary Resistance (2/Day). If the lurking maw fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

Lurk. While in darkness, the lurking maw can take the Hide action as a bonus action to hide one of its tentacles.

Radiant Weakness. Whenever the lurking maw takes fire or radiant damage, or any damage while it’s in direct sunlight, it takes an extra 3 (1d6) damage of that type.

BLOODIED

Hungering Abyss. The lurking maw’s wounds bleed an inky black, magical smoke that boils up into a haze of magical darkness when it is bloodied (reduced to less than half its maximum hit points), filling the area within a 60-foot radius of it. This haze lasts for 2 (1d4) rounds. This magical darkness is treated as a magical effect created by a 4thlevel spell slot. It also immediately gains 1 additional legendary action. It doesn’t regain this additional legendary action at the start of its turn.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

ACTIONS

Multiattack. The lurking maw makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tentacles.

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. A creature grappled in this way takes 7 (3d4) piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. If a creature the lurking maw is grappling in this way has 0 hit points at the start of the lurking maw’s turn, that creature is swallowed (no action required), and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the lurking maw, and it takes 14 (4d6) acid damage at the start of each of the lurking maw’s turns.

If the lurking maw takes 20 damage or more on a single turn from a creature inside it, the lurking maw must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the lurking maw. If the lurking maw dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone. Such a creature can also escape by being cut out of the corpse by a creature dealing 10 slashing damage to it.

Tentacle. Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The lurking maw has four tentacles, each of which can grapple one target.

LEGENDARY ACTIONS

The lurking maw can take 1 legendary action, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The lurking maw regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

Crush. The lurking maw crushes a target it is grappling, dealing 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage to it. If the target is grappled by the lurking maw’s bite, it takes an extra 3 (1d6) piercing damage.

Tentacle Attack. The lurking maw makes a single tentacle attack.

Mind Terrors (Recharge 5–6). Up to five creatures within 60 feet of the lurking maw must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw, with disadvantage if the creature is in darkness. On a failed save, the creature becomes frightened for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is stunned until the end of its next turn.

LAIR ACTIONS

When fighting inside its lair, a lurking maw can invoke the ambient magic and terrain around it to take lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the lurking maw can take one lair action to cause one of the following effects:

Grasping Darkness. A new maw tendril appears in a patch of darkness that is a 5-foot cube or larger. It has AC 15, 15 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and uses a single tentacle attack as if it is the lurking maw. Roll initiative for the tendril. It makes one tentacle attack immediately when it appears and again on each of its turns until it is killed, or until its space is fully illuminated by bright light, destroying the tendril.

Inky Pool. A 5-foot-radius sphere of magical darkness (as if by the darkness spell) appears at a point of the lurking maw’s choice within 120 feet of it. This magical darkness grows by 5 feet every round on initiative count 20 until it reaches a 20-foot-radius sphere.

THE UNCAGED

The Uncaged can appear anywhere, operating with unknowable purpose. Some claim they are the souls of ancient warriors, caught up in a planar war through spaces of thought and time until they became the warped forms they now possess. Others speculate they are the fault of some wizard, as so many strange horrors are.

They are a seemingly inexhaustible force, appearing in groups lead by their enigmatic wardens. Though extremely dangerous foes, the Uncaged can only exist in the presence of their planar portals or the strange lanterns carried by their wardens. They collapse—crumbling to dust as if aging millenia—when deprived of their connection, making some scholars suspect they have become unmoored from time itself.

DOORS OF THE UNKNOWN

The Uncaged come through mysterious portals, pouring out when they open. Due to their vital connection to these portals, the Uncaged can only travel 1 mile from their portal, and they disappear back through the portal when their work is done. Where these portals go, no one knows. Any attempt to cross such a portal results in the seemingly complete destruction of the object or creature that passes through.

LANTERNS OF THE WARDENS

The exception to this restriction is the wardens, who carry a lantern-like object that projects the same power. An Uncaged can exist as long as it remains within 300 feet of the lantern. If a warden is slain, its lantern is destroyed. Any living creatures within 30 feet of a warden’s lantern find it quickly drains away their life force (as per the warden’s stat block).

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

PURPOSE AND USE

The Uncaged make a set piece encounter that can be freely deployed in many odd situations. They are a force of collectors, enforcers, and investigators of fundamentally unknowable purpose, that can show up to interfere whenever things that manipulate plans, time, or other powerful magics are involved... sometimes connected in ways only they can understand.

They rarely speak and never negotiate. They show no hesitation in inflicting terrible casualties to achieve their goals, and they do not fear death or pain. They usually come and go quickly, but sometimes set up longer-term residence within the small sanctuaries of their lanterns.

TACTICS

The Uncaged provide an encounter that largely builds itself. The warden serves as the leader and support of a group of basic Uncaged soldiers, adding and mixing in winged Uncaged as needed. As they are dependent on their wardens, the other Uncaged will work to defend them. These soldiers are simple combatants, but highly effective and deadly. The warden provides the more complicated mechanics of the fight, and it will avoid a direct confrontation, if possible.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
True Nature

The original nature of the Uncaged are wardens of a planar prison that was destroyed and pulled into a realm of negative energy and madness during the escape of its most dangerous prisoner. They were trapped in their own jail, twisted and warped, bound in eternal duty by their obsession with punishing those responsible. They now scour the planes seeking clues to finally exact their revenge and mete out draconian punishment to whomever they see fit.

Innate Spellcasting. The warden’s innate spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 17). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: binding curse*, command, compelled query*, detect thoughts, hold person, inflict wounds, misty step 
3/day each: delve mind*, blight, plane shift, psychic drain*, spatial manipulation* 
1/day each: banishment, circle of death , fear, hold monster, mind blast*

Lantern. The warden’s lantern sheds bright light in a 150-foot radius and dim light for an additional 150 feet, which is visible only to the Uncaged. This light travels through walls and obstacles and can’t be blocked or extinguished. If an Uncaged starts its turn in this light, it gains 4 (1d8) temporary hit points. The warden can see any creature inside the light of its lantern with its truesight.

Magic Resistance. The warden has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

Unmaking Aura. The unnatural energy of the warden twists the world around it, draining the life from all nearby living creatures. When a living creature starts its turn within 60 feet of the warden, it must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On failed save, it takes 7 (2d6) nectrotic damage.

ACTIONS

Multiattack. The warden uses its Battlefield Presence or Teleport. It then casts a spell.

Battlefield Presence. The warden commands an Uncaged to make a single weapon attack. The attack roll is made with advantage.

Teleport. The warden magically teleports itself and up to five willing creatures it can see within 60 feet of it, along with any equipment they are wearing or carrying, up to 300 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

Uncaged Gate. The warden opens a gate to its unknowable realm. The gate is 10 feet wide and 10 feet tall. Any creature other than an Uncaged that passes through it dies, and can only be resurrected by a wish spell. The gate closes after 1 minute, or when all Uncaged in the area have passed through it.

ABERRANT ABSTRACTION

Few know the true appearance of an aberrant abstraction as their very existence is antithetical to reality and the sane minds that inhabit it. To most, they appear as flashing, flickering, shadowy things of writhing and ever-changing features—the most often reported of which include tentacles, eyes, and mouths. Their appearance seems to be an illusory construct of mortal minds trying to cope with the intersection of reality and abstract unreality, and piercing that veil with truesight drives most creatures instantly mad.

TACTICS

An aberrant abstraction is most often completely chaotic and unpredictable. It doesn’t care about “winning” in a classical sense, and doesn’t comprehend losing. It merely acts in a way that will inflict disorder and chaos, usually entirely randomly.

It will ignore other aberrations, but otherwise treats all creatures with equal hostility, unless it is under some sort of psionic compulsion. The true nature of these monsters is incomprehensible, and they can more accurately be considered environmental obstacles than creatures.

USAGE

Aberrant abstractions can be deployed in almost any circumstance in which you want to highlight the unworldly weirdness of an environment: near a breaking down portal, in a psionic scar ripped across the land, or in an ancient temple to an outsider god.

They can be added to other encounters with aberrations at higher levels as nuisances that disrupt and wear down players. They also can be used as a solo encounter against low-level parties, or as agents of chaos in fights against other nonaberrations to add an element of randomness and disorder to the fight.

 • At levels 1–4, aberrant aberrations would be a deadly and difficult encounter.
 • At levels 5–10, they are a unique threat, though not a challenging solo encounter, and can play a significant role in encounter design.
 • At levels 11–16, these aberrations remain impactful and provide complexity as minor threats in an encounter.
 • At level 17+, they pose a small, unique challenge and annoyance as minor minions to aberration threats.

 • NPC: Aberrant Abstraction

ADAPTIVE SLIME

A particularly vexing foe, aberrant abstractions are strange slime creatures—likely artificial in nature—that are capable of psionically adapting to not only better suit their environment, but to completely mimic the actions and abilities of those around them. They generally take on the form of other creatures they see, leaving their true form something of a mystery, though they always retain the same slate grey color and have a somewhat melted appearence.

TACTICS

You have several options for the intelligence of these creatures: you can play them as truly cunning, selecting the most devastating ability to copy; you can play them in the middle of just copying whatever did the most damage to them recently (if it did more damage than their Shred Reality would do); or you can play them lacking intelligence, randomly rolling for what they mimic.

USAGE

It is often best that the first time a group of players encounters these it is as a solo set piece. While it will not be an exceedingly difficult encounter in that environment for an appropriately leveled party, it will likely be memorable and they will be forewarned of its abilties if they encounter it in a more difficult, mixed encounter later, upping the tactical nature of that encounter.

 • At levels 1–4, aberrant abstractions are a challenging but not insurmountable threat.
 • At levels 5–10, they remain a challenging encounter, even as a solo threat. While they are unlikely to be deadly, their ability to mimic others can provide something of a scaling threat, particularly in an early encounter. They can be quite deadly at these levels as part of a group encounter.
 • At levels 11–16, they can be a dangerous threat as part of a group due to the difficulty of killing them and their mimic abilities. They should still be considered a significant threat as part of an encounter design at these levels.
 • At level 17+, aberrant abstractions will remain an unusual, dangerous, minion-level threat that will require strategic handling, but they will only provide a challenge when paired with more dangerous enemies.

 • NPC: Adaptive Slime

RAMPAGING IMPRINT

Rampaging imprints are spawned into existence when a powerful psion starts to lose control of its abilities. They are particularly easily created should a psion find themselves in the Astral Plane. It is said that when a particularly powerful psion dies, sometimes hundreds of these undead can be spawned and flung out across the multiverse as the powers explode out of control in the psion’s dying moments.

Appearing as a vaguely person-shaped distortion of swirling, purple energy, they are beings of manifested rage, rampaging eternally until destroyed.

TACTICS

A rampaging imprint is most often devoid of tactics, and will attack whatever it sees. When multiple targets are presented, it will most often attack randomly or whatever attacked it last. Some retain a vestige of purpose or intent that will drive them to attack a specific thing.

USAGE

Rampaging imprints can appear anywhere, cast out into the world through psionic events and echoes. However, they rarely coexist with living creatures as they tend to attack things on sight and thus are best off deployed in isolated or otherwise undisturbed areas.

If deployed as part of a bigger encounter, they can often serve as summons or minions to similar creatures that direct their otherwise directionless rage through psionic power.

 • At levels 1–4, rampaging imprints pose a moderate threat.
 • At levels 5–10, they are a minor nuisance that can pose a threat to low-Strength creatures, knocking the player characters down to give bigger threats advantage.
 • At level 11+, they are unlikely to be a notable threat.

ELDRITCH SPAWN

MIND LURKER

An eldritch foe that shows a surprising mimicry of true thought, these twisted lurkers seem to be capable of some degree of patience and planning. They slowly infiltrate the mind of their vicitims and twist them to madness, sewing chaos while lurking in the darkness. If any have learned their name and retained their sanity, records do not indicate.

USAGE

These make excellent solo threats at low levels, usually tied to a plot point or quest. Beyond that, they serve as mind-meddling minions.

MADNESS REGURGITATOR

Called “Sargurkthul” by ancient texts, madness regurgitators are a pure example of the twisted imitation of life spouted out by the intersection where the very idea of life is a mockery. These creatures devour (and violently regurgitate) the emotions and psionic energy of living creatures. They can be kept by other aberrations as something akin to horrifying pets.

USAGE

These can serve as an artillery unit for any aberration fight that needs more damage and debuffing. They are not particularly dangerous as a solo threat.

NIGHTMARE STALKER

Also known as “Urktathlin” by the rare scholar that has studied beings of the beyond and not gone immediately mad, these creatures seem drawn to those descending into madness, stalking and devouring as their mind deteriorates, savoring that tenuous last grasp of sanity slipping away beneath their fangs.

USAGE

These are a low-level solo threat that can become an excellent pack minion at higher levels.

FEAR EATER

Fear eaters look ponderous and slow, but they can burst into horrifying, lopsided bursts of momentum, bringing all the terror of a jumping spider as they close distance far too quickly for comfort. They possess potent psionic abilities that often reduce their targets to shattered husks before feasting on their flesh. These aberrations are said to gather where the concentrated fear of mortals pools, devouring them and savoring fear and flesh alike.

USAGE

The plague of many small communities, these make a good, early bounty quest to hunt down in a horror-inspired mission.

SCREAMING RUNNER

Running and screaming is a common reaction to encountering one of these, but they are named for their habits rather than the response they instill in others. Swift predators, they revel in terror and chaos.

USAGE

These are a great reason to be afraid of the dark at lower levels, and they are a chaotic pack hunter at higher levels that will continue to be a hefty nuisance.

Introduction

CRAFTING

Crafting has long been a major focus of the game, and something countless players have sought to engage with since the early days; after all, what adventurer wouldn’t want to be better outfitted, better equipped and more prepared... and what adventurer wouldn’t want the chance to put their personal mark on their gear?

The core principle of this crafting system is simplicity and specificity. Everything works with simple, easy to follow rules, but has enough depth to lift the burden from a GM having to fill in every blank by giving specific details for everything. While a GM is always the arbiter of what exists and if a crafting recipe works, by and large this system can be run with as much or as little input as a GM wants to add. It’s a complete package that provides all the necessarily details for your players to get started—and plenty of tables and guides for GMs as well.

WHY DO YOU NEED CRAFTING?

Some people may wonder: why do you need a crafting system? Isn’t that what loot is for? The truth is, in some games, that’s true. Not every adventurer is going to want to pursue crafting. But with a crafting system, not only can you craft what you need without finding it in a dragon hoard, what you find in that dragon hoard can be so much more.

In a game with a robust crafting system, there is no junk, there are just more opportunities and fresh possibilities. A +1 shortsword that no one can use could be the valuable basis of a new spear. Gems, gold, relics, and recyclables... all valid entry points for the crafter’s creativity.

Adventurers are inherently innovative folks on a quest for creative solutions to difficult problems. Crafting gives them that toolbox.

So... why do you need crafting? You don’t. But you should probably want it.

WHO CAN CRAFT?

Anyone! Who can succeed in making something useful? Perhaps a bit of a different story. Crafting is not inherently tied to class, though in some cases some classes may give benefits to it (like Inventor); crafting may come from your background in the form of a tool proficiency, or it may be something you learn during your adventures following the old adage of necessity being the mother of invention.

Crafting is mostly about the time, effort, knowledge and materials. As such, most of crafting is knowing the recipe and having the time and materials needed... but a skilled craftsman works quicker and is more successful, and in this business practice makes perfect, so there are various progression modifiers that apply. Your GM can determine if your background would merit starting your adventure with any, otherwise guidelines for how to gain them are included.

WHAT CAN I CRAFT?

Anything! But this guide is made by a mere mortal, and is thus limited in scope. This guide will provide the principles of crafting for many fields—from alchemy to engineering to woodworking.

The basis of how crafting works is similar between each field, but the recipes, material, and most important results will be radically different... After all, a healing potion, a catapult, and a magic sword are all things you can craft, but the process for each varies quite a bit.

The goal of this document is to teach you how to get started, and provide the basics that will get you a long way into your adventure, but not make a complete codex of everything that could potentially be crafted. When you hit something doesn’t appear in this document, just reference the closest items and make a bit of a leap to what extra steps might be needed to realize your vision into your game world!

A PLAYER-DRIVEN SYSTEM

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
One of the fundamental goals and inspirations of the crafting system is to make it a player-driven system.

It is a system where the player can say “I would like to harvest the monster for ingredients” and “I would like to forage as we go through the forest looking for alchemy reagents” and ultimately “I would like to make a healing potion” and all those rules can be exposed to the player allowing them to directly browse and consider what they want to make, as well as how to make it.

The GM still adjudicates many instances of them, but the ideal is to have a system in which the GM does not have to handcraft every instance of gathering materials and crafting.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Working With Your GM

While the system is meant to enable player-driven choice, always remember to work with your GM. Check in with them when selecting an item you would like to make and confirm that item exists in their world, and any assumptions hold true.

Some GMs may rule that some items have higher rarity or are simply not available at their default assigned rarity. A common example of this may be something like Winged Boots, which are only rated as Uncommon, but some GMs may feel they are a better fit for rare and adjust their difficulty accordingly.
### Layout: end frame

HOOKING YOUR PLAYERS IN

On the other hand, if the GM wants to get the players into it, there are some tools they can use. By far the most effective tool is to give the players reagents as part of loot that don’t have an obvious place to sell them. If you give players 2 curative reagents, they are going to start looking into how they can use those, as they’d much rather have a healing potion.

If you want to go one further though, if you give them 5 curative reagents and they realize they will have a remainder of one... then they start looking into “Well, how do we get a 6th!”

DEPTH AND COMPLEXITY

This system has two goals: to be simple and easy to use, and to be deep and extensible. Naturally these are somewhat at odds, and accomplished by having a great deal of optional depth. To produce standard items with standard effects, the process for finding or buying the materials and using them to make what you want to make will be straightforward.

How much of the detail you want to engage with as a GM can be easily adjusted by how you hand out reagents. By sticking to the standard ingredients and using their generic names, the materials are no more complicated than handing out gold or other rewards (and can even be fully converted easily to a gold-based system if you want the most simplified version), but if you’d like to have specific ingredient names and exotic ingredients there is information in the appendix you can draw from for that.

HOW TO CRAFT

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Crafting under this system is very simple. You collect the ingredients for a particular thing you want to make, and use your skills with tools to make it into that item. The crafting time of this system is very compressed compared to the systems you might find in the base options because this system is not intended to use downtime to gate crafting.

Rather, this is built to work with an adventuring lifestyle. You might need a little time here and there, but it will be measured in hours rather than days and weeks. Consequently, the gates to crafted items are instead the materials and skill required rather than time and gold, though you can certainly use gold to buy those materials in some cases.

Following there is a quick summary, as well as more indepth break down of crafting time and checks, materials and where to find them, and finally the specifics of each branch.
### Layout: end frame

Generic Ingredients

Above and throughout the document, you will see that ingredients are referred to by generic tags like “common curative reagent” rather than specific natures. For example, you may harvest magical herbs, and find Kingsbane in the forest, a poisonous plant. For the purposes of crafting, this can be recorded simply as a “common poisonous reagent” and used as such in crafting.

This greatly simplifies the process of crafting and recording what your supplies are. Narratively speaking, a skilled alchemist can render down the ingredients they want to use in the form they need.

Each crafting profession will have some profession-wide materials that are used in their recipes: reagents for alchemy, metals for blacksmithing, etc.

Some very rare and legendary items will have specific ingredients; this is for flavor rather than balance, though it is up to your GM.

Introduction

SUMMARY AND REFERENCES

QUICK SUMMARY

Each step will be outlined in more depth, but the following serves as a summary and reference for the process.

 • Select an Item. Find the item you would like to craft on a crafting table.
 • Check with your GM. They will confirm if that item exists and has the default rarity in their game. This system is a tool, it does not supersede worldbuilding.
 • Gather the materials. Materials can be looted from humanoids, harvested from more exotic creature types, purchased at stores, or gathered from the wilderness. The specifics of any material and where it can be found is covered in the materials section.
 • Begin crafting! You can find the related tool and ability score on the table below. Use the related tool and skill to determine your crafting modifier using the following formula:

Crafting Modifier = your Related Tool proficiency bonus + your Related Ability Score modifier.

 • You can make progress in 2 hour increments. For each 2 hours spent, make a crafting roll using the formula above and compare the result to the DC listed for the item
 • On failure, no progress is made. If you fail three times in a row, the crafting fails and all materials are lost.
 • On success, 2 hours of progress is made, and you can mark your progress put it aside or continue to craft.
 • Once your completed progress on an item is equal to the crafting time listed, the item is complete.
 • You’re done! Enjoy your shiny new item!

Special Reminders:

 • You can “take 10” on a crafting recipe by doubling the crafting time.
 • The final say on any item is up to your GM. If they disagree with the written recipe, they are correct!
 • Don’t be afraid to ask where you can find materials—the GM wants you to engage with the world and find things!
 • A crafting roll is a special kind of check. You can’t apply boosts other than expertise to your crafting check. In general, the only way other than expertise to boost a crafting roll is to get help from another skilled crafted for the entire duration of the craft. Remember you can use the take 10 option to get slower more certain success, and if a craft has a higher DC than you can achieve using that method, it likely should involve some degree of difficulty and risk.

REFERENCE PRICES

The prices of this system reference the default prices presented for magic items in 5e, as follows. You don’t need to use these prices if you use an alternate economy, but the prices presented are default for ease of use and conversion.

DEFAULT PRICING

XX
Rarity	Consumable Price	Price
Common	25–50 gp	50–100 gp
Uncommon	50–250 gp	101–500 gp
Rare	250–2,500 gp	501–5,000 gp
Very Rare	2,500–25,000 gp	5,001–50,000 gp
Legendary	25,000+ gp	50,000+ gp

Converting Prices

There are alternative pricing models presented in the appendix. If you use a simple conversion, such as 1/10th pricing using some sort of silver-based pricing, you can simply divide based on that. If you have a more complicated pricing version, my recommendation is to pick a few core items and use them as a point of reference for a conversion formula (I’d recommend healing potions, +1/+2/+3 weapons, and plate armor).

VALUABLE ITEMS

In some cases, you may want to make something that is more valuable. While selling more valuable gear may be quite difficult, as is often said, magic has expensive tastes. Many magic items that an Enchanter might want require items of a certain value.

Here’s some examples of specific modifiers you can add to increase the value of an item:

XXX
Modifier	Material	Difficulty	Value Added
Bejeweled	Gemstones	+1 per gem	Value of Gem
Gilded	10 gold scraps	+2	+20

Additionally, you can generally increase the value of an item simply by making it more ornate and exercising greater craftsmanship. You can, when you start crafting an item, raise the DC and/or crafting time of that item artificially. When you do so, that items value is recalculated using the Labor Cost Table in Appendix A.

Here is a list of example break points of more expensive mundane items using different variations of material cost, DC, and number of checks. These are all simply the iterations of the formula presented in Appendix A.

XXXXX

Example

To walk through these prices:

 • A simple item listed here has 1 sp of materials, and takes 1 check with a DC of 8. That is a labor cost of 1 sp, 1 sp of materials, and consequently, the item has a value of 2 sp.
 • A fancy item here has 100 gp of materials, but also takes 8 checks at a DC of 15! That is a labor cost of 144 gp and a small risk multiplier (the chance you lose your materials) resulting in a value of 250 gp.
 • The presented masterwork item has very little material cost with only 1 gp, but is extremely hard to make with 5 checks with a DC of 20, resulting in a massive labor cost of 995 gp, and a final value of 1,000 gp.

So, for example, if you needed a longsword that was worth 1,000 gp, you have a few options:

 • You can add a gem worth 985 gp to the materials when crafting it, resulting in 15 gp + 985 gp.
 • You could raise the checks to 5 and the DC to 20.
 • You could spend 250 gp of materials, raise the DC to 19, and spend 6 checks making it resulting a sword worth 1,103 gp.
 • These cases are largely something you only need to consider when making items for enchanting, and it’s all quite a bit simpler than it might seem, as it’s just expressions of the formula presented in Appendix A.

MAKING YOUR OWN ITEMS

This system is designed to be extensible. While it contains many things, it does not (and cannot!) contain all the things. You can find the rules for building new items in Appendix A: Creating New Items.

ITEM KEY

At some points on the tables that follow you will see some notification such as B . This represents an item that is not core to 5e and has been added by the creator of this Supplement (standing for Bakku).

Introduction

CRAFTING TIME

All items have a crafting time measured in hours. Crafting is completed in 2-hour chunks. Some branches of crafting must make all their checks consecutively (like Alchemy) while some do not (like Blacksmithing or Enchanting). A crafting roll is made every 2 hours of work on an item.

On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours.

If you fail three times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

CRAFTING DURING A REST

During a long rest, you can make up to 2 hours of progress during a crafting project if you do nothing else during the long rest besides craft and sleep. During this time, you have disadvantage on any Wisdom (Perception) checks and a −5 to all Passive Perception checks as you are focused on your craft.

You can make 2 hours of progress on any crafting project by taking this camp action. For most projects, this progress can be banked completing the project 2 hours at a time. For some types of crafting, like alchemy, you can’t make incremental progress, but you can continue for 2 additional hours of crafting before or after a long rest in which you took the camp action “craft” to get 4 hours (for example).

Camp Actions

A recommended system is the Camp Actions which can be found here and provide more formalized rules for how to make use of your time during a long rest.

CRAFTING ROLLS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Each profession lists the related ability modifier and tool used to calculate your crafting roll modifier. In many cases, attempting to craft without the applicable tool is impossible. Your GM may allow improvised tools, and in that case the check is made with disadvantage.

Beyond the tool, most branches of crafting require a heat source, and some require more infastructure. These are generally approached logically and are at the discretion of the GM. For an adventurer looking for more portable workshop tools, investigate the Crafting Magic Spells and Crafting Utility Magic Items sections; these offer additional avenues for increased portability.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

TAKING 10

When you craft something, double the crafting period (from 2 hours to 4 hours per check) to “take a 10” on the crafting roll, meaning that your crafting checks are 10 + your related ability score + your related tool proficiency bonus. This provides a floor level that you can always succeed on if you choose to take your time.

If someone with proficiency is aiding you for the entire duration of the crafting, the crafting check doesn’t gain any bonus, but can be completed in the standard 2 hours.
### Layout: end frame

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Here is a list of some of the additional requirements by branch:

 • Blacksmithing can perform minor crafts with a simple heat source but requires a forge and anvil to make new items.
 • Alchemy and Cooking almost always requires a heat source.
 • Tinkering, Jewelcrafting, and Poisoncraft sometimes require a heat source.
 • Enchanting, Scroll Scribing, Woodworking, Wand Whittling, Poisoncraft, Leatherworking, Engineering, Runecarving rarely require anything besides the tools of the profession.

### Layout: end frame

NPC Crafting

It should always be assumed that when NPCs are crafting, they take this option, and thus craft more slowly but reliably. The slap-dash speed crafting is largely the domain of the players, though at the GM’s discretion the players may convince an NPC to craft faster assuming the risk of their materials.
### Layout: end frame

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

EXPERTISE

Features that grant tool expertise (the ability to add twice your proficiency bonus to ability checks made with a tool) are calculated into your crafting roll modifier, but do not add to the calculated DC the effects of that item have.

BONUSES

A crafting roll is a special type of ability check, and you can’t add temporary bonuses to your roll (such as Bardic Inspiration or the spell guidance) as the crafting roll represents the entire time you spend working the item.

In general, the intention is that no external bonuses apply, unless they specifically state they do. This would include feats (such as ones that allow you to reroll certain rolls), class features (such as ones that allows you to add dice to certain rolls), etc. A GM can apply these bonuses, but they are not intended to work, and can result in checks becoming too easy.

You can gain advantage if another player with proficiency in the related tool helps for the whole crafting time.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

WORKDAYS

When a character is spending all day working, they make 8 hours of progress, and cannot exceed 8 hours working on a crafting project during a day. Players will occasionally want to work longer than 8 hours, but this fails to account for the limitations of mortals: player characters still need to eat, sleep, and will eventually lose their focus and ability to work. This is primarily implemented for balance reasons, but also helps model how much productive time a character can spend; they are not just working 8 hours straight and idling for 8 hours, but rather a model of the natural flow of a day, taking breaks, etc.

A GM can choose to overrule this and allow extreme crafting days in special circumstances, but in almost all cases working over 8 hours on a crafting project would leave a character with one or more levels of Exhaustion.
### Layout: end frame

Materials

MATERIALS

Without materials, there is nothing to craft from. Crafting does not make things from thin air; it makes more useful things from less useful things. Gathering the materials will be the essential first step in any job. Materials are generally found in three ways.

LOOTING & SALVAGING

Nothing is useless when you have a party of crafters. One of the main sources of materials will be the things you find. Nothing is useless when you have an expert craftsman in the party.

GATHERING & HARVESTING

How something is gathered varies depending on the profession; in many cases, it can only be gathered when the opportunity arises. Dragon scales, for example, are a lot easier to gather when there is a dead dragon nearby. Be it harvesting rare herbs, monster parts, or minerals, gathering is an opportunity you won’t want to pass up.

PURCHASING

Rarely will everything you need to craft what you want fall into your hands without the assistance of the oldest and most powerful tool of any craftsman: money. When you don’t have what you need, frequently you can buy it. For some professions, there will be a lot more materials that can be purchased, while others will rely more on the other routes.

Selling and Buying Materials

In general, the buying price of a material is its listed value, and its selling price is usually half of that to an interested property. Between negotiation, market fluctuation, and GM moods, you may get better or worse prices. Note that many materials are simply junk to a party that does not have a use for them and will only sell to interested parties that can use or resell them. Threatening to burn down a merchant’s shop because they will not offer you the listed price may result in an Intimidation check but does not change market realities and is typically not beneficial to your reputation; most merchants that have the gold to buy and sell expensive materials have dealt with adventurers before and are not easily intimidated.

The sources of materials are tied to the pillars of the game. Looting and Harvesting are tied into the combat pillar, Salvaging and Gathering are tied into the exploration pillar, and Purchasing and Rewards are tied into the social pillar. This provides a lot of routes to add these materials to your game based on what works best for your group.

TYPES OF MATERIALS

REAGENTS

Reagents are a huge range of things; most often they are plants that contain some magical essence, but almost as frequently they are harvested from various magically inclined monsters. The exact source of a reagent usually does not matter beyond defining its type, as the part of the reagent used is the fragment of magic contained within that is distilled out.

There are many different ways to make a potion. Consequently, the materials are sorted into categories. These categories include curative, reactive, and poisonous. These each come in the standard material rarities: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary.

Reagents can’t be salvaged once they have been combined into another form (such as potions, essences, or ink).

Reagants can be assumed to weigh 0.2 pounds each.

Interchangeable Reagents

All curative, reactive, and poisonous ingredients are interchangeable. This is intentional to drastically simplify the crafting process and tracking thereof. Individual names are included only to deepen the immersion of the finding and buying ingredients, and can be treated as interchangeable by their label if preferred.

MAGICAL INK

While ink has many uses, crafting is mostly concerned with magical ink which has the power to hold the arcane words of scrolls. This is synthesized by alchemists from the magical properties of reagents, as it is concerned with extracting their magical properties, the exact nature of the reagents used do not effect the final ink beyond its potency.

Magical ink is not typically found or harvested on its own, though it may be found as loot, and in some instances a GM could rule that some blood collected from a fiend, celestial or dragon could be counted as such. It is generally created from reagents or purchased from alchemists that create it from reagents.

Magical ink can’t be salvaged once they have been combined into another form (such as potions, essences, or ink).

Magical Ink can be assumed to wight 0.1 pounds each.

ESSENCES

While reagents are substances that contain a glimmer of magical power that can be harnessed through refinement, Essences are more purified forms of magical power. These come in three types: Arcane, Divine and Primal as well as in the five normal rarities (common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary). These essences are the pure stuff of magic that makes things work.

You can get these by rendering down magical reagents, salvaging magic items, harvesting them from magical monsters, or through the hard work of spell casters. Or you can find them as loot from people that have already done one of those harder steps. The rules for rendering them down from materials are contained within each branch of crafting, while the rules for creating them yourself are under Enchanting, as it is their domain and skill set needed to do so.

While all branches occasionally use essences when extra magical power is needed, they are the primary material of Enchanters, and their pricing can be found in that section.

Essences can be found as loot during the courses of your adventures, but can also be harvested (from monsters), salvaged (from magical equipment), synthesized (from reagents), or created from the raw power of a spell caster, though the method is long and arduous.

Essences are flexible in their exact nature. There are many paths to each desired outcome, and this flexibility is represented in Essences. While the traditional way to make a belt of hill giant strength may call for a hill giant heart as its essence, an enchanter may substitute a dragon heart as their primal essences to make a belt of dragon strength that just has the same statistical effect.

Essences can be assumed to weigh 1 pound each.

SALVAGING ESSENCES

You also may be able to salvage magical essence from unwanted or broken magical items, though such a reclamation process can be difficult, and rarely results in more than a fraction of the essence infused into the original item. An item returns one essence equal to its rarity when harvested. The process takes 2 hours to complete, and doesn’t work if the item is currently attuned to any creature. An essence can only be salvaged from permanent magic items; a permanent magic item is one that recharges or doesn’t have a limitation on its charges or uses. A magic item with charges or uses can only be salvaged while it is at full charges or uses. The item becomes nonmagical after the essence is salvaged from it. If it required magic to function or exist, it is destroyed.

SYNTHESIZING ESSENCES

In addition to harvesting essences from magical monsters fully intact, a more approachable and incremental way is to combine several reagents to get an essence. You have to combine three reagents of the same rarity to gain one essence of that rarity. You can combine reagents in the following ways:

XXX
Essence	Component Reagents
Arcane	1 curative, 1 poisonous, 1 reactive
Primal	3 reactive
Divine	2 curative, 1 reactive

This process takes 4 hours, and requires alchemist’s supplies and a heat source.
### Layout: end frame

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

MAKING ESSENCES

Another potential source of an Essence is being created by a spellcaster. This process is long and arduous, and typically only suited to downtime. A creature with the spell casting feature can create 1 essence during 1 workweek (5 days, 8 hours a day); this process can’t be completed faster and for the duration they are considered to have spent all of their spell slots.

At 1st level or higher can make a common essence in this way, a caster 5th level or higher can make an uncommon essence this way, a caster at 11th level can make a rare essence in this way, and a caster at 17th level or higher can make a very rare essence this way. Legendary essences require special rituals, more casters, and take far longer; they are exceedingly hard to make.

The type of essence produced depends on the source of the spell casting levels as per the table below:

Special Cases Explained

 • Sorcerers produce a type based on their subclass; Dragon or Wild makes Primal, Divine Soul makes Divine, and Shadow makes Arcane.
 • Warlocks likewise produce a type based on their subclass; Archfey makes Primal, Celestial makes Divine, and all others make Arcane.
 • Occultist can produce any type, but takes 1.5x as long to produce an Essence in this manner. A GM can rule based on the special circumstances of a character their power source may be different than normal. This can stand in for Shaman, Witch, or Oracle classes if you use those instead of Occultist.
 • Inventor can stand in for any half-arcane caster of a similar theme.

A half- or third-caster would generate essences at 1/2 or 1/3 their character level, respectively.

INGOTS

Ingots are chunks of metal that can be used to craft things. They are assumed to be relatively pure and weigh 2 pounds each. The default ingot listed in all the crafting tables is an ingot of Steel. These cost 2 gp per ingot. There are cheaper metals (such as Iron); pure Iron can’t be used to craft weapons and armor, but can be used for other items, resulting in a cheaper item. On the other end of the spectrum, more advanced metals such as Mithral and Adamantine can be used conferring special properties, but being far more difficult to work with and costing more.

Ingots can be assumed to weight 2 pounds each.

SALVAGING INGOTS

Metal items can be converted back to ingots quite efficiently, but require a forge to do so. With a forge and 2 hours per item, a metal item can be rendered down into its component ingots. Advanced metals may require special tools to smelt.

SMELTING ORE

Creating ingots from raw ore is largely out of scope for most adventurers, but you can create ingots from raw ore with a suitable facility. For more details see the Components and Materials table under Blacksmithing.

HIDES & LEATHER

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Hides, scales, and carapaces all tend to be harvested from monsters. Leather is a product of hides that can be processed from what it is harvested from the monster.

The GM determines if a monster provides hide, scale, or carapace. Hides do not come in different sizes, rather larger creatures simply provide more hides, and monsters that are not large enough to produce one hide provide only hide scraps.

Scales are likewise abstracted: each increment is simply an arbitrary unit of scales that the unit of scales covers. Scales can be much larger or small from different-sized creatures.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Processing Hides

The process of turning hide into leather takes quite awhile (as per the crafting table), and is often something adventurers can delegate to NPCs (delivering hides to be processed) or do during downtime. If you would like a more expedited system, there is no balance reason for this, and you can short the leather crafting process to taking 2 hours, it just won’t be exceedingly realistic.
### Layout: end frame

Like other crafting branches, there are also named components for more iconic pieces of gear—the stock of a crossbow, for example, or other items. The cost for these items can be found on the common component table, and are generally minor.

Lastly, Tinkerers use essences when constructing things that push beyond the mundane principles of plausibility, crafting magical properties into their inventions.

PARTS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
The term “parts” is used to refer to gears, wires, springs, windy bits, screws, nails, and doodads. Parts can be either found or salvaged or forged from metal scraps (or even straight from ingots by a Blacksmith for those that really want to be industrial about it). The exact nature of each item making up this collection is left abstracted.

In addition, metal scraps are collections of salvaged material that generally fall into the category of things “too small to track” which can then be used for the creations of tinkerers. In addition to all of this, occasionally tinkers will use ingots... particularly ones of tin (which is their namesake, after all).
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Named Components

In almost all cases, named components (such as a “wooden stock” for a crossbow) can be simply abstracted out as a minor cost, but, as always, the level of abstraction is up to the GM.
### Layout: end frame

SALVAGING PARTS

The other main way to acquire parts is to salvage them. What can be salvaged is determined by the GM, but in general common items provide parts, uncommon or expensive items may provide fancy parts, and esoteric parts are found only from esoteric sources at your GM’s discretion. Tools, vehicles, and complex items generally return 1d4 metal scraps and 1d4 parts for a Small or smaller item, 2d6 metal scraps for a Medium-sized item, 3d8 metal scraps for a Large-sized item, and more for larger items, though they may return less of rare types of parts.

WOOD

Commonly available in its lowest quality (firewood), higher quality woods are often found in rather exotic locations. Wooden branches (including wood scraps) are assumed to be of a useful wood that can be worked, while firewood covers everything else, with more useful woods falling into categories such as “quality branches” or rarer options. Wood scraps are assumed to be scraps of common branch quality wood, and consequently can’t be salvaged from firewood. Wooden branches can be assumed to weigh 2 pounds each.

SALVAGING

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
For the most part, wood can’t be easily salvaged. Wood carving is not necessarily a reversible process, and wood can’t be smelted down.

You can render wooden crafted product into wood scraps equal to 4 x the number of branches used to create it.
### Layout: end frame

Quality Branch

A quality branch refers to one that can be made into more precious objects, particularly bows. It is nonmagical in nature, but typically yew when dealing with bows, though ash, mulberry, elm, oak, hickory, hazel, and maple can be used under broader definitions.

Harvesting and Looting

HARVESTING & LOOTING

Harvesting and looting are two paths to the same place, but generally depend on what kind of foe was vanquished and you are now collecting the “stuff” of. Typically humanoid creatures that carry stuff are candidates for the Individual Treasure tables, while Aberrations, Beasts, Dragons, Monstrosities, and Plants are harvesting candidates.

If you don’t normally provide loot equivalent to default treasure tables, you don’t need to start providing loot equivalent to them using these new tables, simple apply these tables as frequently as it makes sense for your game.

Remember that you can fully mix and match as it makes sense. You can replace coinage with gems or art pieces, you can replace crafting items that wouldn’t make sense with coinage, gems, or art pieces, etc. The tables are merely a guide and convenience for what sort of range of materials should come from what sort of creature.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

HARVESTING

REMNANTS

Remnants optionally replace the Individual Treasure table for creatures that leave behind no body on death, like Elementals, Celestials, or Fiends (ones that leave behind a body can use the Harvesting table).

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

LOOT

The Loot tables optionally replace the Individual Treasure for humanoid type creatures. You can use this table in all cases or in some cases.

HOARDS

Rather than replacing the hoard tables, simply use the default hoard table and replace an amount of coins, gems, and art pieces with crafting materials. This ensures that players are still getting the sort of loot they expect, but also fills in new materials into things that would often fill little role beside being converted to coinage at a later date.

Recommendation

I would recommend using the table for all humanoid enemies, but using the Equivalent Gold Value for roughly half of enemies to keep gold flowing into the PCs pockets while also providing abundant crafting supplies.
### Layout: end frame

BASIC HARVESTING

Beasts, Dragons, and Monstrosities can be harvested using Wisdom (Survival) for meat and hides. At a GM’s discretion, a Plant type creature can be harvested for food using the same DC and amount, but providing common fresh ingredients instead of meat. Basic Harvesting takes 10 minutes. At your GM’s discretion, it may take longer for larger creatures.

EXOTIC CREATURE HARVESTING

Applicable Targets: Aberration, Constructs, Dragons, Monstrosities, Plants, Some Undead

A random roll is performed to judge what can be harvested from the monster. For Dragons and Monstrosities, a Wisdom (Medicine) check is required to harvest the material without destroying it, for Constructs, an Intelligence (Arcana) check is required, and for Plants an Intelligence (Nature) check is required. Exotic Harvesting takes 10 minutes. At your GM’s discretion, it may take longer for larger creatures.

If a beast is sufficiently magical, poisonous, or venomous, a GM can opt to use the Dragon & Monstrosity table for exotic harvesting, but this should be rare; even a poisonous beast is usually too mundane for the magical properties of harvested materials, and a beast should always be rolled on the 0–4 CR table regardess of its CR.

At a GM’s discretion, some Undead may be harvested as well if there is something that would make sense for them to provide in this manner, in which case they would use an Intelligence (Arcana) check. Undead are less likely to provide anything of use, simply having a rare chance of providing arcane essences, though some would consider the use of these essences evil.

Double Harvesting

If a monster is applicable for both Basic Harvesting and Exotic Harvesting, you can perform both, but the second check has disadvantage on the roll to successfully gather the materials.

EXOTIC REMNANTS

Applicable Targets: Celestials, Elementals, Fiends, Some Undead

Some creatures typically do not leave behind corpses. While these most often disappear without a trace, sometimes they will leave behind a fragment of the magical forces that powered them as a remnant, in the form of a reagent or essence. These are less likely to result in a crafting item, but don’t require any check to gather it successfully. Gathering remnants is simple to do, and requires only 1 minute.

Applying Material Tables

As a GM, never feel compelled to roll on a table if you feel it makes sense to do something else. The tables provide a baseline, but if you feel that it makes sense of a given monster to leave behind a given material, simply do so, requiring the check that seems most appropriate (using the tables as a guide if you wish).

Gathering

GATHERING

Many of the materials can simply be found growing in the wild, and can be gathered by someone that knows what to look for and spends the time doing just that. When traveling at a slow pace through wilderness for 8 hours or more (i.e. not urban land or farmland), you can make a gathering check, but have disadvantage on the check to harvest anything found.

If you dedicate 8 hours to gathering without traveling, you can make two checks (without disadvantage) or find one item other than an essence of your choice that is available within that biome’s table (making the ability check from the corresponding line of the table to harvest it) or 1d12 of any trivial item (making a DC 8 ability check to harvest it).

The found items then have to be gathered. You can choose to gather reagents, search for materials, or hunt wild game. Roll a d100 and consult the corresponding table below for the relevant biome to determine what is found.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

GATHER REAGENTS

Reagents are harvested by making a Wisdom check. If you have an Herbalism kit and are proficient with it, you can add your proficiency bonus to the roll.

SEARCH FOR MATERIALS

Materials can be harvested with your choice of a Strength, Dexterity, or Wisdom check. If you have proficiency with the Survival skill, you can add your proficiency bonus to the roll.

HUNT GAME

Food can be gathered with your choice of a Dexterity or Wisdom check. If you have proficiency with the Survival akill, you can add your survival modifier to the roll.

Intentionally Slow

Gathering is a time gated system. It is not intended to be the primary source of materials. Rather than being balanced against the loot tables, it’s balanced against the down time activities (and consequently not particularly efficient).

Alchemy

ALCHEMY

Alchemy is a crafting art that almost all adventures have some degree of interest in the results of. The source of the ever in demand Potion of Healings, it is a versatile trade that fuels (sometimes quite literally) the adventuring life.

It doesn’t take many experiences with the powers of potions for an adventurer to consider if they can get away with simmering a Potion of Healing next to the stew over that night’s cooking fire... of course it’s easier said than done for the result of such things to come away not poisonous.

Alchemy tends to be a very quick form of crafting, but with this comes additional risks with most crafts resting on a single roll, and failure resulting in the loss of all materials. Although taking that chance is frequently worth it during a busy adventuring season, consider the “Taking 10” option outlined in the craft introduction when speed is not of the essence.

RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

Alchemy works using alchemist’s supplies. Attempting to craft a potion without these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with these allows you to add your proficiency to any alchemy crafting roll.

Alchemy uses your choice of your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier.

QUICK REFERENCE

While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a potion in its most basic form:

 • Select a potion that you would like to craft from the “Potions Crafting Table”.
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that potion.
 • Use your alchemist’s supplies tool to craft the potion using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less. Alchemy items must be crafted in a single session.
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus with alchemist’s supplies. You can abort the craft after a bad crafting roll if you wish, this counts as a failure.
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the magic item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are lost.

SHELF LIFE & EXPIRED POTIONS

A unique attribute to alchemy, potions once crafted have a shelf life of 1 year before coming expired. This shelf life is shortened to 1 month if the potion contains any reactive ingredient.

If an expired potion is used or consumed within double its shelf life, roll a d4. On a 1, you become poisoned for 1 minute. On a 2 or 3, the potion will work with reduced effect; its duration will be halved if it had a duration, and damage or healing it dealt will be halved. On a 4, it works as expected.

Any potion that is older than twice its shelf life has no effect besides causing the imbiber to become poisoned for 1 minute.

CRAFTING ROLL

Putting that together means that when you want to work on Alchemy, your crafting roll is as follows:

Alchemy Modifier = your Alchemist’s Supplies proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice)

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

For Alchemy, after you make the crafting roll and succeed mark your progress on a crafting project. If you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item). Checks for Alchemy must be consecutive, meaning that if you wish to continue after a failed craft, you need to extend your crafting time.

Failure means that no progress is made during that time. Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged.

ALCHEMY SAVING THROW

Some alchemical creations trigger a saving throw. In instances that they do, the following is the formula for calculating the saving throw. The saving throw is calculated at the time of creation based on the creators attributes and proficiency, and doesn’t change once it is created.

Alchemy DC = 8 + your Alchemist’s Supplies proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom Modifier (your choice)

Herbalist's Limited Alchemy

While herbalism is primarily used for gathering herbs, a creature with proficiency with herbalism kits has a limited proficiency in creating potions in addition to gathering herbs. You can use proficiency with an herbalism kit in place of alchemist’s supplies when creating potions of healing , antidotes, antitoxins, and vials of poison.

When crafting in this way, you use an herbalism kit and proficiency with it in place of alchemist’s supplies. This crafting otherwise works the same as using alchemist’s supplies.

You can add additional reagent modifiers when crafting in this way.

Crafting Walk Through: Alchemy

Here’s a quick example of how alchemy will often play out in a game.

Caius the Wizard is saved from being eaten by a giant plant monster. He wants to know if his suffering was worth anything, so he asks the GM if there was any loot. There wasn’t. Was there anything to harvest from the monster? Well, that’s always possible. The GM asks for a d100. Caius rolls a 54.

It was just a CR 4 monster, so the GM consults the table and asks for a DC 8 Nature Check. Fortunately Caius the Wizard has a +3, so only needs a 5, and rolls an 8. Harvesting successful and now he has 1 common curative reagent.

Knowing that he’s going to need some healing potions to survive the next plant monster, he consults the table and realizes that with just 2 more curative reagents and a glass vial he’d have enough materials.

Next time they walk through a forest, Caius the Wizard asks the GM if there are any reagents about. Slowing down to a slow pass, he can make a gathering check with disadvantage, and attempts to gather reagents. Rolls the d100, and comes up with a 73. The GM asks for a DC 10 gathering check using herbalism kit, with disadvantage as they were travelling. Caius doesn’t have proficiency, but has +1 wisdom, so needs a 9 or higher. He rolls a 14!

The results in 1d4 common curative reagents. He rolls a 2. That’s all the curative reagents he needed! He cleans out the remains of an old healing potion to get a glass vial, and next time they camp, he spends his camp action (2 hours) trying to make a healing potion.

He needs to succeed only once, DC 13. Fortunately he has proficiency in alchemist’s supplies, and a +3 Intelligence, meaning his check is at +5. He needs an 8 or higher.

...He rolls a 3. This a failure! But all is not lost, he can keep trying until he fails 3 times in a row... but he’s already spent his 2 hours, and alchemy checks must be made consecutively.

Not wanting to lose his precious hard won reagents, he stays up late making another check. He rolls a 10! This results in a 15! He’s successfully made a Healing Potion!

Unfortunately he’s stayed up too late, but the next morning the party lets him sleep in to avoid the level of exhaustion.

Two days later, Vandrin the Cleric, the groups only healer, is on death’s door! A quick swig of the healing potion gets him back on his feet, and the day is won thanks to the hard work of making a potion, and adventurers keep a keen eye out for more of those curative reagents!

POTIONS

DRAUGHT OF DAMNATION

Potion, rare

This sticky red liquid has a living viscosity to it, churning slowly within the flask. When you drink this potion, you become a fiend (as if by the spell shapechange for 1 hour). The type of fiend you become is determined by your level. The new form is a random fiend with a Challenge Rating equal to your level, up to a maximum of 10. If there are multiple options at that Challenge Rating, roll to determine which option is selected.

When the effect ends and you revert to your normal form, you take 1d6 necrotic damage equal to the CR of the fiend who’s form you assumed as the toxins of pure evil attempt to destroy your body before relinquishing control of it. If this damage kills you, your soul is dragged to the realm of the fiends by the malignant will of the fiend.

 • Item: Alchemical Napalm (B)

BOTTLED WIND

Concoction, common

As an action, you can open this, casting gust of wind without verbal or somatic components. Alternatively, you can breath from it, letting out only a little bit at a time, breathing directly from the bottle, but each time you must make a DC 5 athletics checks. On failure, you cast gust of wind as above and all the air is lost. You can get 10 minutes of breathable air from one bottle.

 • Item: Bottled Wind (B)

LIQUID LIGHTNING

Concoction, rare

Drinking this potion allows you to zip around for 1 minute as pure electricity. As a bonus action on each of your turns before the effect ends, you can transform into a bolt of lightning and instantly travel in a straight line to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet. This movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks and you are immune to lightning damage while in this form.

You can pass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, as well as through conductive materials such as metal. Each creature in your travel path must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 3d6 lightning damage. You immediately revert to your normal form upon reaching the destination.

BLASTING POWDER

Explosive, common

A fine grey powder with large grains and the faint smell of sulfur and charcoal that comes in small packets weighing 1/2 pound.

When ignited by 1 or more fire or lightning damage, it explodes violently. All creatures within 10 feet of it must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw. On failure, they take 1d4 fire + 1d4 thunder damage, or half as much on a success. The amount of damage increases by 1d4 (both the fire and thunder) and the radius increases by 5 feet for each additional packet of Blasting Powder detonated in the same spot, up to a maximum of five packets. Deals double damage to buildings and structures. Creatures in range of more than one stack of up to 5 explosives at the same time take damage only from the highest damage effect.

Frequently used for mining and other responsible things... until adventurers get their hands on it.

 • Item: Blasting Powder

DWARVEN ALCOHOL

Explosive, common

Only dwarves really know if the name of this liquid explosive is a joke or not, but most assume it is an acquired taste. An explosively flammable liquid that comes in a flask, this flask can be splashed across a 5-foot square within 5 feet. Once splashed, it can be ignited by 1 or more fire or lightning damage. When ignited it explodes in a plume of fire, dealing 2d4 fire damage to all creatures within 5 feet of the container, or within a square that has been soaked with it.

 • Item: Dwarven Alcohol

GRENADE CASING

Explosive, uncommon

A simple construction of a two chambered projectile (typically made of glass). When you add an Alchemist Fire and an Explosive to its separate compartments, it becomes an incredibly dangerous device. As an action, a character can light this bomb and throw it at a point up to 60 feet away. Creatures within the range of the explosive used must make a Dexterity saving throw against the DC of the explosive used, or take damage equal to the explosion + 1d4 piercing damage + 1d4 fire damage.

 • Item: Grenade Casing

NAIL BOMB

Explosive, uncommon

A brutal instrument, this mixes explosive powder and nails to create a devastating fragmentation device. An exceedingly dangerous device. Heavier and more deadly than other explosives, the primary damage comes from the metal shrapnel (nails) flung in all directions. It can be detonated by dealing 1 fire or lightning damage to it. As an action, a packet of this explosive can be accurately thrown 20 feet, but will not detonate on impact (usually). When it detonates, all creatures within 20 feet of the target point must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the crafter’s Alchemy DC. On failure, they take 8d4 piercing damage, or half as much on a success.

You can fuse your explosives. When fused, intentionally dealing fire damage to the explosives (or otherwise lighting the fuse) causes it to detonate on a delay, selected from: short (the end of your turn), medium (the start of your next turn), and long (2 rounds, at the start of your turn).

SMOKE POWDER

Explosive, common

A fine grey powder with large grains and the faint smell of sulfur and charcoal that comes in small packets weighing 1/2 pound.

When ignited by 1 or more fire or lightning damage, it releases a blast of thick black smoke that fills a 20-foot radius. Everything in this smoke is heavily obscured for 2d4 rounds. At the start of your next turn after the number of rounds rolled, the smoke begins to fade leaving everything within the radius lightly obscured, and it clears completely at the start of your next turn after that.

Additional uses of the smoke powder extend the duration of heavy obscurement for an extra 1d4 rounds.

 • Item: Smoke Powder

SIMPLE/POTENT/POWERFUL EXPLOSIVE

Explosive, common/uncommon/rare

A bundled explosive alchemical preparation. It can be detonated by dealing 1 fire or lightning damage to it. As an action, a packet of this explosive can be accurately thrown 20 feet, but will not detonate on impact (usually). When it detonates, all creatures within 10 feet (for common) of the target point must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to the crafter’s Alchemy DC. On failure, they take 1d8 fire + 1d8 thunder damage, or half as much on a success. Creatures in range of more than one explosive take damage only from the highest damage effect.

XX
Name	Radius	Damage
Common	10 feet	1d8 fire + 1d8 thunder.

ALCHEMY MODIFIERS & ADDITIONAL MATERIALS

ALCHEMY MODIFIERS

The following are alchemical modifiers that can be applied to a potion. All alchemical modifiers require approval from the GM if the modifier will work with a given potion or creation.

XXXXXXX
Modifier	Difficulty Modifier	Effect
Aerosol	+8	Require two additional reactive reagents of equal rarity to the rarest reagent of the potion. Rather than drinking it, when uncorked or broken (as an action) it effects all creatures in a 5-foot radius as if they’d consumed it.
Celestial	+3	Requires a common divine essence. Adds the effect of lesser restoration to the potion.
Divine	+6	Requires an rare divine essence. Adds the effect of greater restoration to the potion.
Endothermic	+4	Any fire damage the potion does becomes cold damage
Expansive	+5	Requires an additional common reactive reagent. Expands the area of effect of any area of effect the potion has by 5 feet.
Insidious	+3	The effect of the potions becomes shrouded from magic such as identify. You can make the potion appear as another potion of the same rarity. Another alchemist can identify it by making an Alchemy Check against your Alchemy DC

ADDITIONAL MATERIALS

You can simply load more reagents into any potion, increasing its potency in different ways, though it increases the difficulty. You can make a “custom potion” simply by using these modifiers with no base potion. When you do so, the base DC is 8.

XXXXX
Additional Reagent	Difficulty Modifier	Effect
Common Curative	+2	The potion restores +1d4 hit points when consumed.
Common Reactive	+2	The potion deals +1d4 fire damage when shattered (or consumed).
Common Poisonous	+2	The potion deals +1d4 poison damage when consumed.
Uncommon Curative	+3	The potion restores +2d4 hit points when consumed.

Poisoncraft

POISONCRAFT

A subdomain of alchemy, the profession of poisoncraft is often seen as the “dark side” of Alchemy. While Alchemy often deals in poisonous reagents, typically speaking they aim to tame the poison, channeling it into useful effects. While capable of making crudely poisonous potions, such things are generally considered failures to an alchemist. To a poisoner, they are considered the art itself.

Poisoncraft shares Shelf Life and Reagents with Alchemy; for details regarding those, see Alchemy.

RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

Poisoncraft works using a Poisoner’s Kit. Attempting to craft a potion without these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with these allows you to add your proficiency to any poisoncraft crafting roll.

Poisoncraft uses your choice of your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier, representing your path of knowledge to the art of making deadly things deadlier.

QUICK REFERENCE

While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a poison in its most basic form:

 • Select a poison that you would like to craft from the “Poison Crafting Table”.
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that potion.
 • Use your Poisoner’s Kit tool to craft the option using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less. Poisoncraft items must be crafted in a single session.
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice) + your proficiency bonus with a Poisoner’s Kit. You can abort the craft after a bad crafting roll if you wish, this counts as a failure.
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the magic item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are lost.

CRAFTING ROLL

Putting that together means that when you would like to create poison, your crafting roll is as follows:

Poisoncraft Modifier = your Poisoner’s Kit proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom modifier (your choice).

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

For Poisoncraft, after you make the crafting roll and succeed, mark your progress on a crafting project. If you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item). Checks for Poisoncraft do not need to be immediately consecutive. Failure means that no progress is made during that time. Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage.

If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged.

POISONCRAFT SAVING THROW

When a poison requires a saving throw, the following is the formula for calculating the saving throw. The saving throw is calculated at the time of creation based on the creators attributes and proficiency, and doesn’t change once it is created.

Poison DC = 8 + your Poisoner’s Kit proficiency bonus + your Intelligence or Wisdom Modifier (your choice).

POISONS

Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.

Poisons come in the following four types.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Contact. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

Ingested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You might decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.

Inhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

Injury. Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage. An injury poison typically lasts 1 minute on a weapon, and lasts for up to 5 hits. A creature that takes piercing or slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.

Blacksmithing

BLACKSMITHING

Blacksmithing is a popular professional interest of two sorts of adventurers: those that want to hit things with heavy metal objects, and those that want a heavy metal object between them and the thing hitting them.

While often relying on the town blacksmith to do their work for them is a fine option, rolling up your sleeves and doing the work yourself can allow you to express your creativity... and may save you a few coins in the process.

Blacksmithing is slow hard work, but has a higher tolerance for failure than most, and is more dependent on knowing your material, as the templates you work from tend to be common across many of them.

RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

Blacksmithing works using blacksmith’s tools. Attempting to craft an item without blacksmith’s tools will often be impossible, though a GM may let you use makeshift tools to make a check with disadvantage. Proficiency in blacksmith’s tools allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any blacksmithing check.

While Blacksmiths can benefit from their skills in small ways such as sharpening their weapons and retrofitting their gear on the go, many of their crafting options require a fully equipped Forge; a fully equipped Forge entails forge, anvil, and blacksmith’s tools.

QUICK REFERENCE

While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a blacksmith item in its most basic form:

 • Select the item that you would like to craft from any of the Blacksmithing Crafting Tables.
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that item.
 • Use your blacksmith’s tools to craft the option using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column.
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus with blacksmith’s tools.
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete.
 • On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

Magical Forges

The worlds of the planar multiverse are a fantastical place with many wonders. Sometimes you may find locations that have been constructed in such a way as to leverage powerful primal powers in the forging technique: for example, a forge at the heart of a volcano or atop an ever-frozen glacier, which might imbue items crafted there with special properties.

CRAFTING ROLL

Putting that together means that when you would like to smith an item, your crafting roll is as follows:

Blacksmithing Modifier = your Blacksmith’s Tools proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

After you make a crafting roll, if you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item).

Checks for Blacksmithing do not need to be immediately consecutive. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged. Failure means that no progress is made during that time.

Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage.

“Ice/Dark/Fire” Steel Ingots

The names for Icesteel, Darksteel, and Firesteel are intentionally generic to better map to unique metals that might be present in your setting and may have other names. Adamantine and Mithril tend to be widespread (and consequently open-source metals), but other more unique metals may vary based on setting.

MAINTENANCE & MODIFICATIONS

While the primary purpose of Blacksmithing is to forge armor and weapons from metal, for an adventurer such events are important milestones that generally will not occur every day. The following are some tasks that require proficiency with Blacksmith’s Tools that provide a more day-to-day utility to the proficiency, giving them minor ways to enhance or adapt their gear.

These are minor crafts that can be completed in 2 hours (or as one camp action when using the Camp Actions rules) with the expenditure of 5 gp worth of materials. They can be done as part of a long rest but have limitations the normally crafted items do not (such as a maximum stockpile of minor crafts).

The following are “minor crafting options” for Blacksmiths:

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

MAINTAIN GEAR

One of the perks of having a blacksmith in the field is their ability to keep gear in its best condition, giving you an edge (sometimes literally) in the quality of your gear and weapons. Over the course of 2 hours, a Blacksmith can maintain a number of weapons or sets of armor equal to their proficiency bonus, granting each weapon or armor maintained a special d6 Quality Die.

For a weapon, this can be rolled and added to an attack or damage roll, representing a case where the perfect state of the gear turned a miss into a hit or dealt a bit of extra damage. For a set of armor, the die can be rolled when hit by an attack, and the damage taken from that attack can be reduced by that amount.

Rolling this die doesn’t require an action, but once rolled it is spent and can’t be regained until the blacksmith maintains that armor or weapon again.

MODIFY ARMOR

While the field crafting of armor is often not possible, you can make smaller adjustments on the go. Over the course of 2 hours, you can turn a set of plate mail into a half plate or a breastplate, refit a set of heavy or medium armor to fit another user that is equal in size or smaller than the original user.

MODIFY WEAPON

Every adventure has slightly different preferences in their gear, and your skills allow you to make slight modifications to nonmagical weapons made of metal. These modifications take 2 hours, require a heat source, and require you to pass a DC 14 blacksmithing tool’s check (on failure, the weapon is damaged and has a −1 penalty to its attack rolls until fixed). You can perform one of the following modifications:

Note: Imperfect Results

Using this method will make some... bad weapons. That is largely intentional. If you want to make a more functional weapon, you can make it from scratch using the Weapon Template. This represents quick hacks to an existing weapon.

 • You can weight a weapon, giving it the heavy property. If it does not already have the two-handed property, it gains the two-handed property. • You can remove the heavy property from a weapon, reducing its damage dice by d2.
 • You can add the light property to a weapon without the heavy property, reducing its damage dice by d2.
 • You can silver the weapon (requires 5 silver scraps, doubled for two handed weapons).

### Layout: end frame

REPAIR GEAR

Sometime in the course of adventuring, weapons or armor will become severely damaged, suffering a penalty to its attack rolls or AC. Over the course of 2 hours, you can repair this damage, though at the discretion of the GM you may need other materials to perform this task if it is heavily damaged. Weapons that are entirely broken (such as a snapped sword) are generally beyond simple repair.

(S) Smelting ore requires specialized facilities. This can usually be accomplished in a fully equipped smithy but consult your GM for where it might be appropriate. Adventurers rarely smelt their own ore; these are included primarily for informational purposes. Smelting magical ores may require more specialized facilities or locations.

CUSTOM WEAPON GUIDE

At first glance, it seems that the weapon selection in 5e is quite limited, but with a little knowledge of the system, you can largely expose that template that builds those weapons, and from there, well, the opportunities are limitless! When you would like to craft a template weapon, just follow the steps below:

WEAPON CREATION TEMPLATE

To create a weapon go through five steps to determine the final damage and properties of the weapon. Adding a d2 means increasing the die by one size (e.g. a d6 + d2 = d8) and the converse for subtracting a d2.

STEP 1: SELECT ONE OF...

XXXX
Property	Base Damage Die	Crafting Modifier	Material Modifier	Notes
Simple	d6	12 Base DC	1 ingot	—
Martial	d8	15 Base DC	3 ingots	Becomes a martial weapon

STEP 2: SELECT ONE OF...

XXXX
Property	Weapon Modifier	Crafting Modifier	Material Modifier	Notes
Light	-d2	+1 Base DC	-1 ingot	—
None	—	—	—	—
Versatile	—	+1 Base DC	+1 ingot	+d2 when wielded with two hands
Two-Handed	+d2	—	2x ingots	—

STEP 3: SELECT ALL THAT APPLY...

XXXX
Property	Weapon Modifier	Crafting Modifier	Material Modifier	Notes
Reach	-d2	+2 Base DC	-1 ingot
+1 long haft	—
Finesse	-d2	+3 Base DC	-1 ingot	No damage die cost if the weapon is light or has no other properties
Thrown	—	+2 Base DC	—	—
Heavy	+d2	+1 Base DC	+4 ingots	Requires two-handed

STEP 4: SET DAMAGE DIE/DICE...

You can divide your damage die into smaller dice that equal the same total. For example, a d12 can become 2d6 or be reduced again to 3d4. Each time you do this, the crafting Base DC increases by +1. You can’t divide dice to be lower than d4.

STEP 5: SELECT DAMAGE TYPE...

X
Type	Effect
Slashing	Deals Slashing Damage
Piercing	Deals Piercing Damage
Bludgeoning	Deals Bludgeoning Damage

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

BONUS STEP: MODIFIERS AND MATERIALS

You can additionally add Material Modifiers and Crafting Modifiers to template weapons. These modifiers may add additional properties as listed by the modifier, and their difficult modifier is incorporated into the weapon.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Notes:

 • Thrown can be ranged weapons instead of melee weapons. (Example: Dart)
 • The GM can waive the restriction on heavy property requiring two-handed property but should be aware it opens the door to combining feats for great weapons with the use of shields.
 • Add one short haft for axes, maces or similar.
 • Weapons made of metal require a minimum of half an ingot (like a dagger), even if the table would reduce them zero.

ADAMANTINE BRACERS

Uncommon

While wearing bracers and not using a shield, as a reaction to being hit by an attack, you can attempt to parry the attack with your bracer, adding +2 AC bonus against the triggering attack. If this causes your AC to be exactly equal to the attack roll and the attacking weapon is made of a common metal, the attacking weapon is destroyed.

THUNDER CANNON

Requires Attunement

The principle weapon of a Thundersmith. Deals 1d12 piercing damage, and has the Ammunition (60/180), Two-Handed, Loud, and Stormcharged properties.

 • Stormcharged. When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a Stormcharged Weapon, you can make only one Attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make. If you could otherwise make additional attacks with that action, the weapon deals an extra 3d6 lightning or thunder damage per attack that was foregone.
 • Loud. Your weapon rings with thunder that is audible within 300 feet of you whenever it makes an attack

 • Item: Thunder Cannon (B)

TOWER SHIELD

Common

This is a massive, unwieldy shield. While carrying it, your speed is reduced by 10 feet. Wielding a tower shield increases your Armor Class by 2. At the end of each of your turns, pick a direction. You have half cover from attacks in a cone that direction. Alternatively, you can pick a single target, tracking the movement. You have half cover against attacks from that target (and only that target).

BEYOND THE SYSTEM

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
While blacksmithing allows for a huge amount of custom creation, there will always be new things beyond the system.

The following are some guidelines for how to make something beyond the system.

 • Trivial items should be composed of metal scraps and have a DC in the range of 8–12. These represent things blacksmiths can easily make. Common items should require ingots, and have a DC of 12–18 depending on if they are simple or exotic. Uncommon and rarer items should have uncommon and rarer materials matching their rarity.
 • Blacksmithing alone can make magical weapons only to the extent that magical components are used.
 • If you would like Blacksmithing alone to make fully magical swords, you can largely just take the materials from an equivalent enchanting recipe and add them to materials of the weapon, and then take the higher of the difficulty and crafting time of the projects.

### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Work Together and be Reasonable

The system is, by its nature, extremely extensible. Great pains have been taken to make things as “balanced” as possible. But this doesn’t mean the rules transcend common sense. As a player, tell your GM what you want to make and be open to adjustments to how it would work. As a GM, tell players how their projects will work from the start, and be open to the idea they can make cool things... these crafted items are part of their “loot” and don’t need to be “power neutral” as long as they aren’t breaking anything.
### Layout: end frame

Cooking

COOKING

Adventures need to eat. While some are content to eat the same stale old rations, some prefer to apply their skills to be kept well fed... even in the depths of a dungeon where fresh ingredients can be... strange.

Not only can someone with talent produce tasty treats, but being well fed can have a variety of benefits... particularly when eating correctly prepared magical ingredients.

RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

Cooking works using cook’s utensils. Attempting to craft a meal without these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with these allows you to add your proficiency to any cooking crafting roll. Cooking uses your Wisdom modifier.

QUICK REFERENCE

While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a meal in its most basic form: • Acquire a fresh ingredient by harvesting or finding it.

 • Review the Recipe Tables for Feasts, Snacks or Rations that ingredient would qualify for, and gather the other materials needed listed in the Materials column.
 • Use your cook’s utensils tool to craft the option using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or use the crafting camp action, during a long rest, if the crafting time is 2 hours or less. Meals must be crafted in a single crafting session. All meals require a heat source (such as a campfire).
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Wisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus with cook’s utensils. You can abort the craft after a bad crafting roll if you wish, this counts as a failure.
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the meal is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

DURATION

The duration a meal remains edible depends on the type of meal made. A feast must be consumed within an hour, a snack lasts for 1 day, and rations last 1 month.

INGREDIENTS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
The materials for cooking are fresh ingredients and supplies. A fresh ingredient is something you harvest that can increase the quality of your food and sometimes provide supernatural boosts beyond mere satiation. Staples include seasonings, spices, flour or even turnips! Foods that last awhile can be cooked into perfectly fine meals but have less benefits than eating a good meal. Some ingredients additionally have the exotic property and may confer special effects.

INGREDIENT EXPIRATION

Normal Ingredients expire very quickly and must be used within 24 hours of being harvested or they become unusable. Preserved rations would fall into the staples category and cannot typically be used to cook anything besides basic meals.

The ability to gain any sort of magical benefit is linked to its freshness; even well-prepared preserved foods provide only the benefit of a Basic Meal (which is a satisfying and good tasting meal, but its benefits are not otherwise magical).

Unlike Fresh Ingredients, Staples last significantly longer and do not need to have their expiration tracked for the purposes of this system.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
General System, Specific Examples

Like with all aspects, this crafting system does not attempt to provide systematic specific examples (though they are provided in the appendix), but rather a system that allows you to know the outcome of anything you could cook. For example, a party could acquire 1 common fresh ingredient by harvesting a Hook Horror, and then combine that with 1 common supplies to cook either Hook Turkey Sandwiches or Murder Chicken Tenders, but the benefit from either example would still fall into a Monstrosity Meat Quality Meal category (one step above standard rations).
### Layout: end frame

SATIATION

The magical benefits you get consuming rare and magical foods cannot be gained again until 24 hours have passed for any particular food. When combined with the ingredient expiration above, this typically means that any ingredient collected is only good for a single meal; this is intentional. You can harvest more if you wish, but cooking naturally is a profession of fleeting achievement and fickle opportunity.

CRAFTING ROLL

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Putting that together means that when you would like to create a meal, your crafting roll is as follows:

Cooking Modifier = your Cook’s Utensils proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

For cooking, all crafting rolls must be made consecutively. Make all checks listed for the items. If you succeed a greater number of times than you fail, the meal is successfully completed, otherwise, it is inedible, and all ingredients are lost.
### Layout: end frame

EXOTIC INGREDIENTS

While standard meals are made from a selection of ingredient types and generally a seasoning, exotic ingredients have specialized effects. When making a meal from these ingredients, the meal’s effect is a combination of the effect of the exotic ingredients added.

An Exotic Meal (meal cooked entirely from exotic ingredients) doesn’t need a recipe and has a crafting time of 1 hour, and the difficulty is the difficulty of all the exotic ingredients added together, with 1 check needed per exotic ingredient added.

Exotic ingredients can be combined with a standard meal by adding the DC of the standard meal to the combined difficulty of the exotic ingredients added. This can cause unusual meals and frequently has unattainably high difficulty to make it work, as adding random new components to meals typically wrecks the taste.

BASIC COOKING & CAMP ACTIONS

While the rules present a handful of ways to use cooking for more exotic ends, the most common application of cooking is just to produce an edible meal during a long rest—something any adventuring group would welcome. This is called a Quality Meal and provides greater benefit than rations, though the benefits it provides are not magical, and merely stem from it being a satisfying meal. You can do so by expending 1 fresh ingredient of any type and 1 common supply to feed up to 5 allies or willing creatures, or by spending common supplies per creature being cooked for. These materials must have been purchased within the last week. Any creature, even one not proficient with cook’s utensils, can take this action.

You and all willing creatures (willing to eat your cooking) regain an additional Hit Die (up to their maximum). If you have proficiency with cook’s utensils, creatures regain additional Hit Dice equal to your Proficiency bonus.

PURCHASING MATERIALS

Due to the rules on ingredient freshness, typically ingredients cannot be purchased in a way that is relevant for cooking recipes. You can purchase Supplies (of any type) that can be used to make Basic Meals.

Rarity	Material Price
Supplies (Salt, Staples, etc)	1 gp
Uncommon Supplies (Uncommon spices, oils, rare seeds, etc)	10 gp
Rare Supplies (Hard to get luxury goods)	100 gp

HARVESTING INGREDIENTS

Unlike other things, you can harvest from monsters, as there’s little chance of failure in harvesting. There’s generally more to harvest than meaningfully used. You can consume Monstrosity, Dragon, Beast and Plant Type creatures for magical benefits. However, your GM may allow other creature types as special delicacies at their discretion.

Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being prepared. After consuming this hearty meal, you become satiated for the next 24 hours. You gain the benefits for a common feast but can gain additional benefits by trading in Hit Dice that would be gained as part of your next long rest after consuming this meal. These Hit Dice are consumed after calculating how many you would have after the rest (including the benefits of the feast), but you can trade Hit Dice in this way you would normally lose if you have more than your maximum Hit Dice.

You can trade Hit Dice in this way up to a number equal to your proficiency bonus. The benefits scale is based on the rarity on the feast.

Benefits [Uncommon/Rare/Very Rare/Legendary]
Roll a [ d4/d6/d8/d12] per Hit Die traded and gain temporary hit points equal to the value rolled.
Trade three Hit Dice for an additional spell slot of [ 1st/2nd/3rd/4th] level
Gain a point that can be expended like Inspiration by trading [ 5/4/3/2] Hit Dice per point.

Any benefit from a feast fade after 24 hours.

SEAWORTHY BOUILLABAISSE

Food (feast), uncommon

 • Item: Seaworthy Boullabaisse

HEROES’ FEAST

How Feast Spent Dice Work

If, for example, at level 4, if you start a rest with 2 Hit Dice, and consume a meal that would give an additional Hit Die, you would end the rest with 5, but your maximum is 4, so you would lose the 5th. This allows you to spend that extra fifth Hit Die for additional benefits. You could spend 3 Hit Dice on these benefits, but doing so would mean you only have 2 Hit Dice after the long rest.

WHAT DOESN’T KILL YOU... FEAST

Food (feast), uncommon

Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being prepared. After consuming this dubious meal, you gain resistance to poison damage, and gain advantage on saving throws against being poisoned for 24 hours.

If the source of a poison saving throw is the same as the source of the meat or poisonous reagent used to make the feast, the advantage against being poisoned by that creature or effect lasts one week.

MEAT FEAST

Meat/Hearty/Superb/Legendary Food (feast), uncommon/rare/very rare/legendary

Up to 5 creatures can consume this feast within an hour of it being prepared. After consuming this hearty meal, you become satiated for the next 24 hours. Consuming the essence of a properly prepared creature of great power confers some of its power to you while satiated by the feast.

You can add +1/+2/+3/+4 to ability checks and saving throws of the prepared creatures highest stat (if multiple stats are tied, the cook chooses which when preparing the meal). Alternatively, the cook can bring forth exotic properties of the creature, conferring one trait of the cooked animal to those that consume it as per the following table (this replaces the benefit to ability checks and saves):

XX
Minimum Rarity	Creature Boon
uncommon	Hold Breath, Keen Senses, Pounce, Stone Camouflage
rare	Amphibious/Water Breathing, Web Walker
very rare	Pack Tactics, Spider Climb
legendary	Magic Resistance, Regeneration, Shapechanger(Mimic)

The details from the creature boon can be found on the creature stat block. The cook must be aware of the creature’s property to make the meal imbue that property, and the GM may adjust the property in cases where it would not work for players or be too powerful as written. At the GM’s discretion, any ability can be added to this list.

SNACKS

FLAME BREATHING JERKY

Food (snack), uncommon

A tough jerky with exotic flavoring. Very spicy, uncomfortably so. After a creature consumes this snack as an action, they gain the following benefits for the next 10 minutes:

 • You can’t be put to sleep by magical means.
 • You have disadvantage on Wisdom checks.
 • You have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws to maintain concentration on a spell.
 • You can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 10 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 2d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

You can eat a number of pieces of this jerky equal to your Constitution modifier per day.

MINT CHEW

Food (snack), uncommon

A chewy minty candy. You can pop one into your mouth as a bonus action. While being chewed (for up to 10 minutes), you are energized and can ignore the effects of up to 3 levels of Exhaustion for the duration and can’t be put to sleep by magical means.

You can only gain this benefit once per day, after which consuming additional pieces of the candy has no effect until you finish a long rest.

 • Item: Mint Chew

MORPH COOKIES

Food (snack), uncommon

Consuming one of these has the effects of casting alter self, however you can’t change the adaptation unless you consume another cookie. This effect doesn’t require concentration to maintain and can be extended by consuming an additional morph cookie.

If the ingredient came from a mimic, you can additionally transform your appearance to creatures with a different basic shape than you, though you remain the same size.

SEEING STICKS

Food (snack), uncommon

A stick of hard tacky substance. You can pop one into your mouth as a bonus action. While being sucked (for up to 10 minutes), you gain expanded senses and have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks, saving throws against Illusion spells, and Intelligence (Investigation) checks to see through illusions, though because of the bad taste inherent to the formulation, continuing to suck on the seeing stick requires concentration, as if concentrating on a spell.

By adding the optional common supplies ingredient, they can be sweetened, granting you advantage on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your concentration against spitting them out; this increases the DC of the recipe by 1.

 • Item: Seeing Stick

QUICKENING CANDIES

Food (snack), rare

A small hard candy ball, with extreme caffeinated properties. When you pop one of these into your mouth as a bonus action, you are under the effect of haste for 1d4 rounds. You still suffer the normal effect of haste ending when the effect ends.

Enchanting

ENCHANTING

Enchanting is a hard and expensive profession, but one eagerly pursued by many all the same. The makers of miracles, the craftsmen of wonder, no other profession holds the fascination of adventurers quite like Enchanter, for their domain encompasses the large majority of magical items.

An item need not pass through an enchanter’s hands to be magical, indeed many a blacksmith has forged a magical blade with the right materials, but the true wonder of enchantment is to turn the mundane magical. An enchanter can turn even the most base and commonplace item into something wonderful and powerful, and when given the head start of working with an already well-crafted item can craft things of legend.

Many enchanters further specialize in subdomains such as Scroll Scribing or Wand Whittling for more specialized good that require more specialized tools, with many even pursuing such things as Jewelry Crafting in order to create the precious items that most easily enchant, but the general field of Enchanting still covers a large swath of the wondrous.

Scrolls are heavily featured as a component of nearly all magical items, forming the basis for the powerful enchantments that imbue them with their magic. These are templates of a sort, and thus the ability to craft scrolls with Scroll Scribing is often the most desired of the subdomains for an Enchanter.

RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Rather than any one tool, Enchanting primarily uses the Arcana skill. Due to the subdomains of scrolls (Scroll Scribing) and runes (Runecraft) being part of enchanting, proficiency in Calligraphy Tools is often useful. 0

Enchanting uses your Intelligence modifier. While magic comes in many forms (Arcane, Primal, Divine) and many casters are able to control it with other aspects of their talent, the ability to systematically bind it into magic items requires a deep understanding of its inner workings that can only be accomplished through meticulous study and knowledge.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Psionic Items

The items listed on the Psionic Items table are the exception to this rule. These are items infused with psionic power, and instead use the “Psionics” skill, a skill that any psionic character can be considered proficient if not using special psionics rules.

These items are something of a subtype of enchanting and may not exist in your setting if psionics aren’t included. Consult your GM.
### Layout: end frame

QUICK REFERENCE

While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a magic item in its most basic form:

 • Select the magic item that you would like to craft from any of the Magic Item Tables.
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that item.
 • Use your Arcana skill to infuse the option using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less.
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Intelligence modifier + your Arcana proficiency.
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the magic item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

MATERIALS: ESSENCES & COMPONENTS

The materials of enchanting are Essences and Components. Essences come in three different types: Arcane, Primal, and Divine—as well as five rarities: common, uncommon, rare, very rare, and legendary. What an Essence is can vary greatly, as they are things of innate magic that is used to power the Enchanter’s creations.

They could be organs of magical monsters (such as the heart of a dragon which would be a rare primal essence) or they can be synthesized from magical reagents into a magical compound. Components are a broad category of items ranging from the base item you are enchanting to any extraneous bits needed to be added. One unique component that is present in many enchantments is a Spell Scroll of various types of spells that form the basis of the sort of the magic the item has.

REPLACING SPELL SCROLLS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
A crafter that is capable of casting magic can replace the spell scroll in an enchantment with the ability to cast that spell, but when doing so they must cast that spell for each crafting check they make on that item. This is an exhausting process, draining their magic far more deeply than normal casting, and confers a level of exhaustion each time this technique is used to replace a crafting check. If a magic item requires multiple scrolls, only one of them can be replaced in this way, though if an additional spell caster that can cast the necessary spell can assist you, they can replace a second scroll, though suffering the same penalty.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Exhausting & Difficult Method

This mechanic is intentionally quite difficult to use—even for casters that are capable of casting the spell. The typical process would be to make the scroll first to formalize their thoughts and process, laying down the patterns and templates for the magic item. It also removes a very costly gate in the process, so should not be easily bypassed.
### Layout: end frame

CRAFTING ROLL

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Putting that together means that when you would like to enchant an item, your crafting roll is as follows:

Enchanting Modifier = your Arcana proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

After you make a crafting roll, if you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item).

Checks for Enchanting do not need to be immediately consecutive. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged. Failure means that no progress is made during that time.

Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage.

Enchanting Example and Walkthrough

Caius the Wizard has a keen interest in magic items. At the start, all he has is the Arcana skill and big dreams. Let’s walk through how turn those into a magic item.

Caius the Wizard happens to be a level 4 wizard at this moment in time. Strangely, he’s the only human in his party, and his lack of darkvision has been holding them back.

So, Caius decides to embark on making a set of Goggles of Night. Let’s follow his journey:

First, he'll need to gather those materials. He needs googles, a scroll of darkvision, a common primal essence, and an uncommon arcane essence. Goggles are easily acquired from the local merchants for a few gold pieces, the rest will be a bit trickier.

A common primal essence isn't that hard to come by, and can be found by harvesting elementals, dragons, giants, or monstrosities, even at the humble 0-4 CR rating of monsters Caius has been dealing with.

The uncommon arcane essence will require a hunt. His party takes on a CR 5 undead, but on their d100, they roll a 64... no luck, all that was left was some mangled bones and 3 uncommon poisonous reagents. After a few more tries, it seems luck isn't with them. Fortunately, Caius has a plan. That uncommon poisonous reagent he got can be combined with an uncommon curative and uncommon reactive reagent in a simple 4-hour process with Alchemist's supplies and a head source.

Boiling them all down, he's left with some magical residue forming an uncommon arcane essence. Now all he needs is the scroll of darkvision. Caius really should have had this spell long since given his darkvision shortcomings, but never got around to it.

So, Caius shells out 90 gp to buy a scroll of it. Not to learn it though, of course, as soon he'll never need that spell again!

All the pieces are assembled. As a level 4 Wizard with 16 Intelligence and proficiency in the Arcana skill, Caius Enchanting Modifier is 2 (his Arcana proficiency bonus) + 3 (his intelligence modifier), so is 5 total.

During his next long rest, Caius makes his first crafting check, and rolls a d20! It's a 10. 10 + 5 = 15, so he has a success. He's 1/4th of the way done but needs to spend the rest of that long rest sleeping.

The next day he rolls again, 6! That's only 11! One failure. The next night it's a 15 for a check of 20! That's a second success. Tragedy almost strikes with the next two checks being a 4 and 2, with results of 9 and 7 respectively, that's two more failures! All his hard work is on the edge of being lost.

But Caius asks to take an extra-long break at the next town. He uses the 4 hours to make his next check, taking a 10 on the roll to forestall disaster. As he wasn't too ambitious and the Goggles of Night are only DC 13, that means by taking 10, Caius has a minimum check of a 15, and it's a pass. Feeling better, now that he's no longer one checked from the whole project failing, he makes his next check on the road, and gets an 18, for a total of 24. A fourth success, and he can take his watch that night with darkvision at long last...

...unfortunately he'd been up too late working and fell asleep, so his party got ambushed anyway, but that's a story for another time!

Caius the Wizard now can see in the dark as well as any pointy eared elf or long bearded dwarf! It took a bit longer than he'd hoped, but now Caius has his very first shiny magic item made by his own hands!

MAGIC ITEMS

ARCBLADE

Weapon (longsword), very rare (requires attunement)

This item appears to be a longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to cause a blade of dark lightning to spring into existence, or make the blade disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with shortswords or longswords, you are proficient with the arcblade.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals lightning damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit a creature with it, you can cause lightning to arc from the target to a different creature of your choice that you can see within 5 feet of it. The second creature takes 1d8 lightning damage.

The arcblade is able to absorb ambient electrical energy to briefly enter a supercharged state. If you take lightning damage while this weapon’s blade is active, you can use your reaction to capture some of that energy and store it for up to 1 minute. The first time you hit with the arcblade before the end of the duration, the target takes additional lightning damage equal to half of the damage you took. This property can’t be used again until the next dusk.

 • Item: Arcblade (B)

BOARDING PARTY

Weapon (any ammunition), uncommon

This is a magical piece of ammunition carved with pirate motifs. This piece of ammunition changes size to fit the size of the weapon used (becoming large when loaded into a large weapon). You can use this piece of ammunition to cast translocating shot(B) once without expending a spell, targeting this piece of ammunition. Once used in this way, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.

 • Item: Boarding Party (B)

BOW OF MAGIC MISSILES

Weapon (any bow), very rare (requires attunement by a creature that is proficient with shortbows or longbows)

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, it has 5 charges. While holding it, you can expend 1 charge as an action and draw the bowstring, causing two gleaming arrows of magical force to materialize. You immediately fire each arrow at a creature that you can see within 600 feet of you. You can direct the arrows at one creature or multiple, and each arrow automatically hits its target, striking simultaneously.

You can choose to expend additional charges as part of the same action to fire one extra arrow per charge expended. Each arrow deals force damage equal to 1d6 + your proficiency bonus. The bow regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the bow’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the bow retains its +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls but loses all other properties.

 • Item: Longbow of Magic Missiles (B)
 • Item: Shortbow of Magic Missiles (B)

BREASTPLATE OF THE GOLDEN RETRIEVER

Armor (breastplate), very rare (requires attunement)

You have a +1 bonus to AC and advantage on saving throws to resist being frightened while wearing this armor.

This armor has 3 charges, which it regains daily at dawn. As an action, you can expend 1 charge to cast the warding bond spell or 2 charges to cast the faithful hound spell from the armor without requiring material components. When warding bond is cast in this way, a spectral golden retriever appears next to the creature you are bonded with and follows it dutifully. The golden retriever is incorporeal, and it can shed bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet upon the bonded creature’s request (no action required).

 • Item: Breastplate of the Golden Retriever (B)

CAPTAIN'S COAT

Armor (studded leather), rare (requires attunement)

Functional and fashionable, this long pirate captain’s coat is reinforced for combat and draws the eyes to its ornate design. While wearing this coat, you have proficiency in navigator’s tools, vehicles (water) and you have a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

Multiple pockets are hidden on the inside of the coat, able to conceal small objects. A creature attempting to search your person must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check in order to discover the hidden pockets.

Sailor’s Mouth. Once per short or long rest, you can use a bonus action to cast the vicious mockery spell (save DC 15) while wearing the coat. When cast in this way, the target takes extra psychic damage equal to your Charisma modifier.

 • Item: Captain's Coat (B)

CASCADE CATALYST

Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement)

While holding this catalyst, you can use it as spell casting focus for your spells. When you roll damage for a spell, for each die that rolls its highest value, you can roll one additional die of the same type and add it to the damage dealt.

 • Item: Cascade Catalyst (B)

CRYSTAL KEY

Wondrous item, very rare

An intricate crystalline doorknob with intricate carved patterns. This crystal contains a psionically constructed space that can be manifested by placing it against any flat vertical surface large enough for a Medium-sized door to appear on and speaking the command word. It creates a door that leads into this interdimensional space. The size of this space depends on the size of the object the doorknob is placed again. If the space is at least 10 feet long by 10 feet wide, it creates a simply furnished bedroom with a bed, light, chair, and desk. The atmosphere in the room is comfortable and the air is breathable.

For each additional 10 cubic feet of space in the object the doorknob is placed in, additional rooms appear, in the following order:

 • A bathroom furnished with wash tub and running water (the water is potable).
 • A comfortable study furnished with a writing table, chair, bookshelves and fireplace.
 • A workshop with basic artisan tools and work benches.
 • A kitchen that contains no food, but all basic cooking tools, and an always hot oven.
 • Additional bedrooms, up to four additional rooms.
 • Anything created by the extradimensional space can’t leave the extradimensional space.

These rooms are extradimensional and do not truly exist within the object and can’t be accessed by any means other than through the door (they do not structurally affect the object, or allow you to access entrances or areas within the object).

 • Item: Crystal Key (B)

CRYSTAL BALL OF THIEVING

Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)

This crystal ball is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (save DC 17) with it.

You can use an action to cast the mage hand spell while you are scrying with the crystal ball, the spectral hand appearing within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. When cast in this way you can make the spectral hand invisible. When the scrying ends, so does the spell, and any object held by the spectral hand is teleported into your open hand or to an unoccupied space at your feet. Teleporting an object via this method is unreliable and has a chance to fail. Roll a d20 to determine if you are successful. If you have had physical contact with the object before add 5 to your roll. If the object has spent more than 24 hours in your possession, add 10. The DC is 15. On a failure, the object reappears in the space that it occupied before the spectral hand interacted with it, or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is now occupied. Once used, the thieving power of the crystal ball can’t be used again until the next dawn.

Curse. Each time you successfully steal an item using this crystal ball, the owner of the item immediately sees an image of your face and hears your name in their mind. They don’t necessarily know the context, but if your theft arouses suspicion, it’s a likely deduction that you are related to the disappearance of their possession.

 • Item: Crystal Ball of Thieving (B)

DAGGER OF THE OGRE MAGE

Weapon (shortsword), uncommon (requires attunement)

This blade was once used as a dagger by an ogre mage but is nevertheless large enough to be a shortsword. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This blade’s hilt is hollow and can hold up to 3 cantrip spell scrolls. Cantrip scrolls left within the compartment for 1 minute activate one of the three clear gems adorning its grip. Once activated, you can cast these cantrips at will using your spellcasting modifier. If you don’t have a spellcasting modifier, use your Intelligence modifier instead. You have proficiency with these cantrips. Cantrips cast from the blade use the weapon as an arcane focus and allow you to perform any somatic components with the weapon instead of requiring a free hand. Scrolls contained within the sword are not destroyed after using them in this way.

When you cast a cantrip using the sword that deals damage, the sword’s damage type changes to match the cantrip’s for 1 minute or until you end it early (no action required).

 • Item: Dagger of the Ogre Mage (B)

DARK FATHOM ARMOR

Armor (studded leather), very rare (requires attunement)

This dark, sea-soaked suit of armor smells of brine and is covered in eldritch runes. You have a +1 bonus to AC and can breathe normally underwater while wearing this armor.

In addition, while wearing this armor, you can use an action to cast the black tentacles spell (save DC 15) from it. When cast in this way, the spell targets a 15-foot square centered on your location that does not follow you when you move. In addition, you do not need to concentrate on the spell and are immune to its effects when cast in this way. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dusk.

 • Item: Dark Fathom Armor (B)

DECOMBOBULATOR

Wondrous item, rare

This small mysterious device can emit a projected field within 5 feet of it that heats matter until it undergoes a state change, from a solid to a liquid, or from a liquid to a gas. It has no effect on gas. The target area is always in the shape of a cube and can be as small as a 1-inch cube or as large as a 5-foot cube. The process takes 1 minute. If a creature ends its turn in the projected field, it takes 2d6 fire damage. This damage doubles each consecutive turn it ends in the area. This damage is also taken by any creature attempting to hold or touch something in the area of effect. This field may burn away the effects of some spells that would be subject to its effects at the discretion of the GM.

 • Item: Decombobulator (B)

DOODLE RING

Ring, common

This magic wooden ring is always covered in splotches of charcoal, ink, or paint, regardless of how well or often it’s cleaned. While wearing the ring on a finger, you can touch that finger to a solid surface and begin to draw. The drawing uses your finger to make marks as if it were a piece of charcoal, ink quill, or paintbrush (your choice). The marks you make can be in any color. Any drawing made by the ring can be easily smudged or washed away without leaving any marks behind. The ring can have up to a total of 5 square feet covered with drawings in this way at any time. Drawing more than that begins to erase the previous marks, and any mark left after 24 hours of being made is magically erased.

 • Item: Doodle Ring (B)

DRAGON TAMER LANCE

Weapon (lance), legendary (requires attunement)

This slender, iridescent lance is covered in an enchanted finish that resembles the hardened scales of many dragons. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While attuned to the weapon, you can understand and speak Draconic.

This lance has 8 charges and regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges each day at dawn. When you hit a target with the lance, you can expend 1 of its charges to deal an extra 3d6 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison damage (your choice) to the target. If you expend a charge in this way when you hit a dragon, it must also succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you until the beginning of your next turn. For the purpose of this weapon, “dragon” refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.

Whenever you expend a charge in this way to deal extra damage, you can choose to expend a 2nd charge and deal an extra 1d6 damage of the same type to the target and prevent it from using its reaction until the start of its next turn.

Wyrmling Steed. In addition, while holding the lance, you can use an action to cast the find steed spell from it. Once this property has been used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn. When you use the lance to cast this spell, you can choose to summon a dragon wyrmling instead of a normal mount by expending a number of charges equal to its challenge rating (maximum 2). You determine the kind of dragon summoned, although its alignment towards good or evil must be the same as your own. If your alignment is neutral, you can summon a wyrmling of either alignment. The wyrmling counts as one size larger when used as a mount and cannot use its breath weapons.

Forceful Impact. If you move at least 20 feet straight toward a Medium or smaller target and then make a melee attack with the lance against it while within 5 feet of the target, you make the attack with advantage instead of disadvantage. If you hit, you can immediately roll to attack another target 5 feet directly behind the first, without advantage, as part of the initial attack.

ESSENCE CRYSTAL

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

A translucent crystal capsule that contains a small amount of a mysterious dark colored liquid.

While in possession of this crystal, an attuned creature gains a +1 bonus to to ability checks and saving throws of the crystals attribute type.

These crystals can be cracked, and the liquid inside makes a potent essence for forging powerful runes.

Curse. While attuned to the crystal, you have vivid dreams of lives that are not your own, seeing glimpses of the souls that contributed their essence to the liquid within the crystal.

GALVANIC SPINE

Weapon (whip), rare (requires attunement)

A segmented metallic whip that crackles with lightning. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic whip, and it deals an extra 1d4 lightning damage on hit.

This whip is highly articulated and can move with surgical precision, allowing it to serve as an extended reach for certain tasks. As an action, you can attempt to grapple a creature, entangling with the whip. When you do so, you can make a Dexterity (Athletics) check to initiate and maintain the grapple (instead of Strength). A creature that starts its turn while grappled with this whip takes 1d4 lightning damage.

Additionally, you can pick up objects weighing 10 pounds or less within 10 feet, pulling them toward you, or interact with objects within 10 feet. You can use the whip as a set of thieves’ tools +1 when interacting with objects within 10 feet.

HELM OF HEROES

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

You gain a +1 bonus to AC if you’re wearing no armor while wearing this helmet. You can still use a shield and gain this benefit. In addition, while wearing no armor, the helm becomes suffused with glory and glimmers for 1 minute whenever you roll a 20 on an attack roll. While the helm is glimmering in this way, you gain temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns equal to half your level, and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you can’t be frightened.

 • Item: Helm of Heroes (B)

HERO’S SHEATH

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a paladin)

An ornate sheath built for a longsword; this sheath infuses a blade stored within with divine power. When you draw a weapon stored in this sheath, the first attack you make with it after drawing it forth has a range of 30/60 (using the weapons normal attack modifier) and deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage.

If you expend a spell slot to empower this special attack using your Divine Smite feature, the blade emits a holy blast that deals damage equal to the Divine Smite targeting all creatures within 15 feet. The range of the cone increases by 15 feet for each level of spell slot expended on the Divine Smite. The target of the attack takes the Divine Smite damage as normal if the attack hits, while all other creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw with a DC of 16. On failure, they take radiant damage equal to the damage dice of the Divine Smite damage (this is not doubled if the attack is a critical hit), or half as much damage on a successful saving throw.

A longsword that is sheathed in this sheath for at least 24 hours is infused with divine power. Its damage die is increased by one step (from a d8 to a d10, and its versatile damage from a d10 to a d12) and it counts as magical for the purposes of overcoming resistance to damage. This bonus lasts until another weapon is sheathed in this scabbard.

 • Item: Hero's Sheath (B)

HOLY SYMBOL OF THE ARCANE

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric)

This is a special holy symbol often belonging to the order of a god dedicated to knowledge or magic, imbued with special power by the god or their agents with the ability to confer arcane magic to a disciple.

When an attuned user is preparing spells for the day, they can prepare spells from the wizard spell list in addition to the cleric spell list, but any spell prepared in this way is prepared at one level higher than it normally would be. For example, if they were to use this holy symbol to prepare the fireball spell from the wizard list, it would be prepared as if were normally a 4th-level spell (not gaining benefits from being up-cast as a 4th-level spell).

An attuned cleric can have a number of spells prepared this way equal to their Wisdom modifier.

 • Item: Holy Symbol of the Arcane (B)

HULKING BRACERS

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While wearing these bracers, as an action you can gain the Enlarge effect from the enlarge/reduce spell without requiring a spell slot or concentration. The effect lasts until deactivated as a bonus action. You can remain enlarged for up to 1 hour per day, all at once or in several shorter uses. If you run out of time while enlarged, you shrink to your normal size. The bracers regain their 1 hour of usage at dawn each day.

 • Item: Hulking Bracers (B)

JAVELIN OF THE HARPY EAGLE

Weapon (javelin), rare (requires attunement)

This barbed javelin embeds itself into creatures and hinders their movement. A creature hit by this javelin has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the javelin is removed. While you are within 120 feet of the javelin and you can see it, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word, causing the javelin to viciously remove itself from the target and fly back to your open hand or to an unoccupied space at your feet. You can choose to remove the javelin as a part of the attack while wielding it in melee. Alternatively, any creature can remove the javelin with an action. When the javelin is removed, the barbs deal an extra 1d6 piercing damage to the creature.

 • Item: Javelin of the Harpy Eagle (B)

LOST ERA EMANATOR

Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)

This ancient device is fueled by a mysterious power source. It hums to life and glows softly when held. The device’s arcane design is nearly inscrutable and requires careful examination to decipher its function. In order to attune to the device, you must first succeed on a DC 16 Arcana check, otherwise the attunement fails, and you can’t attempt it again for 24 hours.

The device has 12 charges. While holding it, you can use the attack action to emit a ray of concentrated heat from the device, expending 1 charge for each attack. The device functions as a ranged weapon with the ammunition and two-handed properties, a normal range of 60 feet, and a long range of 240 feet. While you are attuned to it, you can add your proficiency bonus to attack rolls with the device. Additionally, when you attack with the device, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of Dexterity, for the attack rolls. The device deals 3d8 fire damage (this damage doesn’t benefit from ability score modifiers) to any target it hits.

As an action, you can expend 3 charges to fire a supercharged ray from the device. The ray is 90 feet long and 6 inches wide. Any creature within this area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw and take 8d8 fire damage on a failure, or half damage on a success. This ray is able to penetrate through 1 inch of metal, 6 inches of stone, or 1 foot of wood, leaving a scorched hole 6 inches in diameter.

The device regains charges by storing arcane energy. Any creature can cast a spell of 1st through 6th level into the device by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the device. If the device can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The device regains 1 charge for each level of spell slot used.

Orville examined the strange device that he had just unearthed. It gleamed and glinted in the torchlight, despite its apparent age, and the craftsmanship was like nothing he had ever seen. He traced his finger along the intricate grooves and amber-like appendages, daydreaming about the people who could have crafted such a curious contraption.

 • Item: Lost Era Emanator (B)

RAIMENT OF THE RACCOON

Armor (studded leather), very rare (requires attunement by a rogue)

You have a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. While wearing it, you are imbued with the hardiness of a raccoon. Your rogue feature Evasion now applies to Constitution saving throws as well.

Keen Sense of Touch. While wearing this armor you develop a hypersensitive tactile awareness. You can add your Wisdom modifier to Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks, thieves’ tools checks and Intelligence (Investigation) checks that use your sense of touch. You can reliably detect the surface details, such as engraved writing or material properties, of an object by touching it.

Curse. While attuned to this armor you become obsessively hygienic. You must spend at least 10 minutes washing your hands to benefit from a short or long rest and you prefer to dunk your food into water before eating it.

 • Item: Raiment of the Raccoon (B)

SAVAGE TALISMAN

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

While wearing the talisman, you gain a +1 bonus to the attack rolls and the damage rolls you make with unarmed strikes and natural weapons. Such attacks are considered to be magical.

 • Item: Savage Talisman (B)

SCALE MAIL OF THE PANGOLIN

Armor (scale mail), rare (requires attunement)

While wearing this armor you gain a burrowing speed of 10 feet. You can use your burrowing speed to move through sand, loose earth, mud, or ice, not solid rock.

This armor can adjust itself to provide superior protection, allowing you to curl up into a ball as an action. Until you emerge (on your turn, no action required), you gain a +5 bonus to AC, and you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws. While curled up, you are prone, your speed is 0 and can’t increase, you have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws, and you are incapacitated. Attack rolls made against you do not have advantage normally granted by the prone condition. Additionally, a creature can roll you along the ground in front of itself if it succeeds on a DC 10 Strength check (no action required).

 • Item: Scale Mail of the Pangolin (B)

SHAWM OF SUNDERING

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a bard)

When a creature adds one of your Bardic Inspiration dice to an attack or damage roll, and they hit a target within 60 feet of you, you can play the shawm as a reaction to deal thunder damage equal to one roll of your bardic inspiration die to the target.

Additionally, you can play the shawm as an action to cast thunderwave, shatter, or lightning bolt, and that spell can’t be cast from it again until the next dawn.

 • Item: Shawm of Sundering (B)

SQUALL CALLER

Weapon (battleaxe), uncommon (requires attunement)

This battleaxe has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. It has 3 charges. While holding the battleaxe, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast gust of wind (save DC 13) from it. The Squall Caller regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Amplified. If the Squall Collar is within 60 feet of this battleaxe, it gains the following properties:

 • You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
 • Immediately after being thrown, the battleaxe flies back to your hand.
 • The saving throw DC for spells cast from the battleaxe increases to 15.
 • When you cast gust of wind from the battleaxe, the distance pushed increases by 5 feet, and you can choose any number of creatures within the area of effect to automatically succeed on their saving throw. Additionally, you can choose to cast gust of wind without requiring concentration, but the spell ends at the start of your next turn.

 • Item: Squall Caller (B)

SQUALL COLLAR

Wondrous item, rare (requires attunement)

This cold steel choker is forged into the shape of a roiling storm. It gives you a static shock when touched. It has 3 charges. While wearing the collar, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast sleet storm (save DC 15) from it. The Squall Collar regains all expended charges daily at dawn.

Amplified. If the Squall Caller is within 60 feet of this collar, it gains the following properties:

 • Wearing the collar allows you to see normally through heavily obscured areas caused by weather or spells such as sleet storm or fog cloud.
 • The saving throw DC for spells cast from the collar increases to 16.
 • When you are targeted with an attack that deals thunder or lightning damage, you can use your reaction to gain resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn.
 • Additionally, the Squall Caller deals an extra 1d8 of the triggering damage type for 1 minute. Once the collar is used in this way, the ability cannot be used again until the next dawn.

QUANTUM CHAOS BOX

Wondrous item, rare

This is a mysterious box that harnesses primordial chaos to manipulate aspects of reality within it, creating random chaotic things. When opening this box, roll a 1d12 to determine the results. If opened again, the box is empty until the next dawn.

Additional Effects

An ambitious GM can replace any effect rolled with a new effect (either positive or negative) to keep the box indefinitely chaotic. Ideas that might lead to further adventures can even be included. Imagine the ramifications of opening the box and finding a lich’s phylactery.

THEURGE’S LIBRUM

Wondrous items, very rare (requires attunement by a wizard)

This hefty ornate spell book remains pristine in all conditions, its cover depicting detailed sacred inscriptions. After studying the contents of this book for 8 hours, the user can comprehend a unifying theory of divine and arcane power, though such a comprehension mystically fades from the mind if they ever lose possession or un-attune from the librum, until they are once more in possession and attuned to the librum.

When found, the librum contains the following spells: cure wounds, bless, lesser restoration, gentle repose, revivify, spirit guardians, commune, guardian of faith, dawn, and mass cure wounds. The spells contained within can be prepared as Wizard spells for the attuned user but can’t be copied out of the spell book. Casting these divine spells exerts a special strain on a wizard, however, and they can only cast a total number of spell slots of spells that do not appear on the Wizard list from this book equal to their Wizard level, after which they must finish a long rest, refreshing the number of spells they can cast.

In addition, it contains 10 empty pages, each of which can contain one additional spell from the cleric list. If you come across a cleric spell in written form (such as a scroll) the spell can be permanently copied into the librum, expending one of the empty pages. The process of copying the spell into your ritual book takes 2 hours per level of the spell, and costs 50 gp per level. The cost represents the material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it.

YVES’ THIEVES’ TOOLS

Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)

You have a +1 bonus to ability checks using these thieves’ tools. As an action you can hold these tools up to a door to hear through it, as long as it’s no thicker than 1 foot, alerting you to the location of any creatures within 20 feet of the door. If you set off a trap while using these tools to pick a lock, you have advantage on any saving throws to resist the trap.

 • Item: Yves' Thieves' Tools (B)

Scrollscribing

SCROLLSCRIBING

Scrollscribing is the process of creating magical scrolls. Critical both as useful ways to cast spells and as the core of the magic formula used in enchanting, every adventuring group’s magic blokes are well served by the ability to make scrolls.

RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Scrollscribing works using Calligraphy Tools. Attempting to craft a scroll without these is impossible.

The related ability score is Intelligence. While spellcasters of any stripe can make scrolls of the spells they know, the process is one of systematic application of magical theory to lay down the spell in a function that can later be used.

Additionally, like its kin Wand Whittling and Enchanting, proficiency in Arcana is required; without proficiency in arcana, you can’t add your Tool proficiency to the crafting roll.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Scriptures

A GM can choose to allow a cleric to use Wisdom in place of Intelligence and require proficiency in Religion instead of Arcana. Scrolls produced this way are called Scriptures and can only be used by others of the same faith.
### Layout: end frame

QUICK REFERENCE

While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to make a scroll in its most basic form:

 • Select a spell you know that you would like to craft from spells you are able to cast, or through Alternate Methods (see “Magic Formula”).
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for a scroll of that level and type.
 • Use your Calligraphy Tools to write the scroll using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less.
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency with Calligraphy Tools (if you have proficiency in the Arcana skill)
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the magic item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

MATERIALS: INK & PARCHMENT

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
The materials for Scrollscribing are Ink and Parchment. Ink and Parchment used in scrolls is typically purchased, and below are the price tables. Some types of rare parchment may be processed from rare alchemical ingredients by an alchemist or from the hides of magical creatures by a leatherworker. If they are found as part of treasure, they are calculated as any other precious non-currency treasure would be calculated.

The ink used to create scrolls must be a special formulation that allows it to contain the magical essence behind the glyphs, script, runes, and words that make up a magical scroll. This ink is created by alchemists, but can be purchased at the below rates:

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

After making a crafting roll, if you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item).

Checks for Scrollscribing do not need to be immediately consecutive. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged. Failure means that no progress is made during that time.

Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage.
### Layout: end frame

CRAFTING WITHOUT ESSENCE

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
A crafter that is capable of casting magic can replace the essence when crafting a spell scroll with the ability to cast that spell, but when doing so they must cast that spell for each crafting check they make on that item. This is an exhausting process, draining their magic far more deeply than normal casting, and confers a level of exhaustion for each crafting check made this way.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
A Difficult Process

This is intentionally a difficult process, as stockpiling spell scrolls is something that should be challenging, otherwise magic can end up trivializing many encounters, and this method of crafting removes a large potential cost barrier.
### Layout: end frame

MAGICAL FORMULA

To craft a spell scroll, you must know the Magic Formula of the spell you want to make a Spell Scroll of. The easiest way to do this is to be able to cast the spell. You always know the Magic Formula of a spell you know how to cast. Otherwise, you need to have deep knowledge of the spell to be able to make a scroll of it. The following are some ways you can gain that knowledge:

 • Have it in your spellbook as a Wizard.
 • Have it in your spell manual as an Infusionsmith Inventor.
 • Have it in your ritual book as a ritual caster.
 • Have a spell scroll of it (DC +2)
 • Study its magical formula and record it. To learn a spell in this way requires proficiency in arcana and 1 day (8 hours per day) of study per level of the spell, as well as access to a teacher or book that records the spell. Once learned, you can record it in a Magical Formula book and can subsequently make scrolls of it.

SCROLL ESSENCE TYPE

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
The type of Essence is determined by the spell list the spell comes from; if it is on multiple spell lists, it is determined by how you have access to the spell. If you have access to the spell via multiple lists or the written form of the spell, you can pick which Essence to use for spells that have multiple options.

Wand Whittling

WAND WHITTLING

Unlike many magic items that are crafted and then enchanted with magic, a wand is purpose built to store the magic it will contain, worked from wood and infused with magic as a single process, with different intricacies based on the type of magic it will wield.

Wands are very valuable to adventurers, and the power they wield should never be underestimated, as they can save precious resources. While the typical wand is an attunement item that can recharge, there is a weaker variety of lesser wands that are consumable items, more akin to multi-use scrolls that are easier to make.

RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

Wand whittling works using Woodcarver’s tools. Attempting to craft a wand without these is impossible.

The related ability score is Dexterity. While spellcasters of any stripe can make wands of the spells they know, the process is one of systematic application of magical theory to integrate the spell into a wand in a function that can later be used.

Additionally, like Scroll Scribing and Enchanting, proficiency in Arcana is required; without proficiency in arcana, you can’t add your Tool proficiency to the crafting roll.

QUICK REFERENCE

While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you at a glance to follow the steps to make a wand in its most basic form:

 • Select a wand from the Greater Wand Table you would like to make, or a spell you would like to make a Lesser Wand of.
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for a Wand from the appropriate table.
 • Use your Woodcarver’s tools to create the wand using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less.
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Dexterity modifier + your proficiency with Woodcarver’s tools. On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the wand is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

MATERIALS: WOOD & ESSENCE

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
The materials for Wand Whittling are wood and essences. The wood used in wands is typically purchased, and below are the table of prices. If they are found as part of treasure, they are calculated as any other precious non-currency treasure would be calculated. Low-level wands can use common woods that are not magically attuned, but more powerful magic will cause such mundane wood to instantly splinter or catch fire, requiring the use of rare and exotic woods.

Essences are varied in nature but are what power wands. Essences are shared with Enchanting, and more details can be gleaned from the Essences section under Enchanting.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
What Are Rare Woods?

The most common examples would be from trees in exotic locations—wood from the Feywild or from the outer planes. The exact nature of the wands can match the spell for flavor, but the details beyond rarity are not considered by default for the system. Some examples are provided at the end of this section.

PURCHASING WOODEN BRANCHES

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Like with many materials, one popular method of acquisition is to simply spend gold. A piece of wood here is typically a branch about 2–3 feet long and moderately narrow, suitable for a wand with some whittling.

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

For Wand Whittling, after you make the crafting roll and succeed, mark your progress on a crafting project. If you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item). Checks for Wand Whittling do not need to be immediately consecutive. Failure means that no progress is made during that time. As usual, failing three times in a row results in the crafting project being a failure, and all materials are lost.
### Layout: end frame

WAND WHITTLING SAVING THROW

Some wands require a saving throw, the following is the formula for calculating the saving throw. The saving throw is calculated at the time of creation based on the creator’s attributes and proficiency, and doesn’t change once it is created. A saving throw doesn’t include any expertise or other bonuses a crafter has to the crafting roll.

Wand DC = 8 + your related tool proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

LESSER & GREATER WANDS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Many adventurers are most familiar with greater wands, forged with such skill and power that their power regenerates each day at dawn, providing nearly unlimited ability to wield magic. These are, however, the rarer exception: Greater Wands. Their weaker cousins (Lesser Wands) work in a similar fashion, but do not naturally recharge, and must be recharged to be used again.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

RECHARGING LESSER WANDS

Recharging lesser wands is fairly simple; you can either expend 1 essence of the rarity required to craft that wand and perform a ritual that takes 2 hours, expending the essence and restoring all charges to the Lesser Wand (this only works with Lesser Wands), or you can expend 2 spell slots equal to the level of the spell the wand can cast (1st level for cantrip) during this ritual to recharge a single charge; you can repeat this ritual to recharge the wand multiple times, up to its maximum charges.
### Layout: end frame

MAGICAL FORMULA

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
For Greater Wands, they have known formulas that can be deduced as part of crafting (as with Enchanting), and you do not need to know the spell or effect before crafting the Wand, though they are typically harder to craft.

To craft a Lesser Wand, you must know the Magic Formula of the spell you want to make a Lesser Wand of. The easiest way to do this is to be able to cast the spell. You always know the Magic Formula of a spell you know how to cast. Otherwise, you need to have deep knowledge of the spell to be able to make a Lesser Wand of it. The following are some ways you can gain that knowledge:

 • Have it in your spellbook as a Wizard.
 • Have it in your spell manual as an Infusionsmith Inventor.
 • Have it in your ritual book as a ritual caster.
 • Have a spell scroll of it (DC +2)
 • Study its magical formula and record it. To learn a spell in this way requires proficiency in arcana and 1 day (8 hours per day) of study per level of the spell, as well as access to a teacher or book that records the spell. Once learned, you can record it in a Magical Formula book and can subsequently make scrolls of it.

WANDS

LESSER WAND

Wand, common/uncommon/rare/very rare/legendary

This wand has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the spell infused in it it. For 1 charge, you cast the base version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend (if applicable for the spell). The DC of the spell is crafter’s Wand DC.

The wand doesn’t regain charges naturally but can be recharged (see recharge rules for Lesser Wands).

Lesser wands that cast 3rd-level spells or higher require attunement to use.

 • Item: Lesser Wand

BLAST STICK

Wand, common

This wand has 20 charges. This wand is considered a ranged weapon with a range of 60/180, and the Light property. It deals 1d6 force damage on hit. Each time you make an attack with it, it expends one charge. If you have a spellcasting modifier, you can use your spellcasting ability in place of your Dexterity modifier when making an attack with this wand.

The wand regains 1d10 + 10 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand breaks.

 • Item: Blast Stick (B)

GOODBERRY DISPENSER

Wand, common

This wand has 10 charges. While holding it as an an action you can tap the tip to your palm and expend 1 of its charges to create a single berry as if from the goodberry spell in your hand.

The wand regains 1d10 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand explodes, producing a splattering burst of sticky and sour juice.

 • Item: Goodberry Dispenser (B)

MAGICIAN’S WAND

Wand, common

This wand has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast minor illusion. When you cast minor illusion using this wand, you have advantage on Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks involving tricks or illusions until the end of your turn.

The wand regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand breaks.

 • Item: Magician's Wand (B)

WAND OF CHORES

Wand, common

This wand has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast prestidigitation.

The wand regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand breaks, dumping the last 10 instances of filth it has cleaned up.

 • Item: Wand of Chores (B)

WHISPERSTICK

Wand, common

This wand has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 of its charges to cast message. You need to point the wand at the target to cast it in this way.

The wand regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand’s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand breaks, making a loud bang audible up to 100 feet.

 • Item: Whisperstick (B)

Leatherworking

LEATHERWORKING

Leatherworking is often seen as something of the “light armor” equivalent to a blacksmith, but it covers quite a bit more ground than that. While it may be the unsung hero, an adventurer’s best friend is a study leather backpack. Backpacks, belts, waterskins, quivers and more all fall to these artisans to make and can prove essential to everyday life.

In addition to their more mundane wares, however, leather, hide, scales, and carapaces of monsters in the fantastical settings these craftsmen find themselves in often provide more opportunity than the basic components of mundane items. A leatherworker is essential if you wish to get the most mileage out of your harvested monsters.

QUICK REFERENCE

While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to work items from leather:

 • Select the item that you would like to craft from any of the Leatherworking Crafting Tables.
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that item.
 • Use your leatherworker’s tools to craft the option using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less.
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Dexterity + your proficiency bonus with leatherworker’s tools.
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time toward the total crafting time.
 • On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

Leatherworking works using leatherworker’s tools. Attempting craft items with Leatherworking without these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with these allows you to add your proficiency in them to any Leatherworking crafting roll.

MATERIALS: LEATHER & HIDES

Leatherworking uses leather and hides, primarily harvested from monsters, however sometimes they work with heavy quilted clothes, metal pieces, and tough carapaces.

CRAFTING ROLL

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Putting that together means that when you would like to make an item, your crafting roll is as follows:

Leatherworking Modifier = your Leatherworker’s Tools proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

For Leatherworking, after you make the crafting roll and succeed, mark your progress on a crafting project. If you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item). Checks for Leatherworking do not need to be immediately consecutive. Failure means that no progress is made during that time.

Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged.

LEATHER ITEMS

LEATHER BUCKLER

Shield, common

A small, simple, and light shield. Wielding this shield increases your armor class by 1. You can benefit from only one shield at a time. You can hold items in the same hand as this light buckler, but any weapon wielded with the same hand has disadvantage on weapon attacks, and any grappling attempts with that hand are made with disadvantage.

 • Item: Leather Buckler (B)

SCOURGE

Weapon, common

This heavy metal-tipped whip is a martial weapon with the reach property. It deals 2d4 slashing damage on a hit. Due to its unwieldy nature, you have disadvantage when you use a scourge to attack a target within 5 feet of you.

 • Item: Scourge (B)

THROWING BANDOLIER

Adventuring gear, common

This is a quick access bandolier that can old weapons with the thrown property. It can be configured to hold 2 javelins, handaxes, or light hammers, or 4 daggers or darts. Weapons held in it can be drawn as part of making an attack with them without using an object interaction to draw them as long as you have a free hand to draw them.

Tinkering

TINKERING

Tinkering is applying creativity to junk to make new things. Sometimes even useful new things. Ranging from the humble crafts to complex contraptions, tinkering is a broad category that any adventuring party can benefit from.

Oft the purview of peddlers and wanderers, they have a broad skill set and tend to excel at working with limited resources and their wit rather than expensive shopping lists of materials, though many will say they have a bad habit of collecting too much junk with the idea that things can be handy when you would least expect it...

QUICK REFERENCE

While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to tinker up an item in its most basic form:

 • Select the item that you would like to craft from any of the Tinkering Crafting Tables.
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that item.
 • Use your tinker’s tools to craft the option using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less.
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Intelligence + your proficiency bonus with tinker’s tools.
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

Tinkering works using tinker’s tools. Attempting to tinker item without these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with these allows you to add your proficiency in them to any Tinkering crafting roll.

Most of the time tinkers need only the minimal heat of a basic fire and their tools to work, though any craft that requires an ingot may require a forge at the discretion of the GM.

MATERIALS: PARTS & SCRAP

Tinkering uses metal scraps, miscellaneous parts (simply referred to as “parts”), and, in cases of making more magically functional things, essences to imbue them with their power. The term “parts” is used to refer to gears, wires, springs, windy bits, screws, nails, and doodads. Parts can be either found or salvaged or forged from metal scraps (or even straight from ingots by a Blacksmith for those that really want to be industrial about it). The exact nature of each item making up this collection is left abstracted.

In addition, metal scraps are collections of salvaged material that generally fall into the category of things “too small to track” which can then be used for the creations of tinkerers. In addition to all of this, occasionally tinkers will use ingots... particularly ones of tin (which is their namesake, after all).

Like other crafting branches, there are also named components for more iconic pieces of gear—the stock of a crossbow, for example, or other items. The cost for these items can be found on the common component table and are generally minor.

Lastly, Tinkerers use essences when constructing things that push beyond the mundane principles of plausibility, crafting magical properties into their inventions.

Named Components

In almost all cases, named components (such as a “wooden stock” for a crossbow) can be simply abstracted out as a minor cost, but, as always, the level of abstraction is up to the GM.

CRAFTING ROLL

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Putting that together means that when you would like to smith an item, your crafting roll is as follows:

Tinkering Modifier = your Tinker’s Tools proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

For Tinkering, after you make the crafting roll and succeed, mark your progress on a crafting project.

Checks for Tinkering do not need to be immediately consecutive. Failure means that no progress is made during that time.

If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged.

TINKERING SAVING THROW

Some gadgets a Tinkerer creates require a saving throw, the following is the formula for calculating the saving throw. The saving throw is calculated at the time of creation based on the creator’s attributes and proficiency and doesn’t change once it is created. A saving throw doesn’t include any expertise or other bonuses a crafter has to the crafting roll.

Tinkering DC = 8 + your Tinker’s Tools proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier

LANTERN SHIELD

This bizarre buckler has a lantern, a gauntlet, defensive spikes, and a short sword built into it. You must wear the gauntlet in order to wield it, and it only grants a +1 bonus to AC. The bullseye lantern concealed within the shield casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. The aperture that sheds light through the shield can be opened or closed with a bonus action while wearing the gauntlet, instantly igniting or extinguishing the lantern.

While the lantern is covered and you are attacked in darkness by a creature within 60 feet of you that is also in darkness, you can reveal the light (no action required) to momentarily blind the attacker, imposing disadvantage on the attack. A creature can’t be blinded in this way again for 24 hours.

If a creature within 5 feet of you misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to deal 1d4 piercing damage to the attacker with the shield’s defensive spikes.

Additionally, the shield has a shortsword built into it that can be wielded while wearing the gauntlet. You can deploy or retract it with a bonus action. You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with this shortsword and you are proficient with this weapon if you are proficient with shields. Attacks with this weapon are made with disadvantage if you are holding a weapon without the light property, or an object longer than 1 foot or heavier than 5 pounds in your gauntlet hand.

This crossbow lacks the loading property and is fitted with an internal magazine that can hold up to six crossbow bolts. It automatically reloads after firing until the magazine runs out of ammunition. Reloading the magazine takes an action. You are proficient with this magical weapon if you are proficient in either light crossbows or quarterstaffs.

 • Item: Ordinary Walking Stick

Woodcarving

WOODCARVING

Woodcarving is the branch of crafting concerned with creating objects from wood, primarily working with branches to carve bows, musical instruments, and some simple armor. A simple branch of crafting, it provides many of an adventurer's common necessities, particularly for those with more ranged styles. A good woodcarver never fears running out of arrows and can find their materials quite readily.

QUICK REFERENCE

While each step will go into more depth, the quick reference allows you to at a glance follow the steps to work items from leather.

 • Select the item that you would like to craft from any of the Woodcarving Tables.
 • Acquire the items listed in the materials column for that item.
 • Use your woodcarver’s tools to craft the option using the number of hours listed in the Crafting Time column, or during a long rest using the crafting camp action if the crafting time is 2 hours or less.
 • For every 2 hours, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Dexterity + your proficiency bonus with woodcarver’s tools.
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost, and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail 3 times in a row, the crafting is a failure, and all materials are lost.

RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

Woodworking works using woodcarver’s tools. Attempting to craft items with Woodworking without these will almost always be made with disadvantage, and proficiency with these allows you to add your proficiency in them to any Woodworking crafting roll.

MATERIALS: WOOD

Woodworking is a bit more straight forward than other types of crafting in that it primarily has only category of material: wood. This can come in several different form factors, but is measured in branches, consistent pieces of useful wood.

CRAFTING ROLL

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Putting that together means that when you would like to make an item, your crafting roll is as follows:

Woodworking Modifier = your Woodcarver’s Tools proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

For Woodworking, after you make the crafting roll and succeed, mark your progress on a crafting project. If you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item). Checks for Woodworking do not need to be immediately consecutive. Failure means that no progress is made during that time. Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components are reserved for that item.
### Layout: end frame

CARVED BRANCHES

Woodworkers can increase the rarity of a branch through expert carving techniques. A wooden branch of higher quality produced through woodcarving can’t be used as the material to make a branch of even higher rarity, but otherwise a carved branch serves as a branch of their finished rarity for crafting (such as enchanting or other woodworking items that call for a branch of that rarity).

Effectively, carving the branch can only increase the rarity of a branch by one step.

Runecarving

RUNECARVING

Runecarving is the art of marking special magical enhancements in the form of magical runes. These are symbolic representations that channel and focus power to confer a special magical effect to the item they are marked on.

QUICK REFERENCE

The following is a quick reference to follow for each step of carving runes:

 • Select a basic item you would like to mark a rune on. This can be an mundane item, gem, nonmagical weapon, or nonmagical armor.
 • Select a rune you would like to mark on that item from the table based on the item type.
 • Acquire the materials listed in the materials column for that rune.
 • Use your Related Tool (based on your Runecraving tradition) to craft the option using the number of hours listed in the crafting time column. You can make progress in 2 hour increments.
 • For every 2 hour increment, make a crafting roll of 1d20 + your Wisdom or Intelligence (based on your Tradition) + your Proficiency bonus with your related tool.
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the item is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail three times in a row, the crafting is a failure and all materials are lost.

RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

Rune carving comes in two different traditions; you can mark runes from either tradition, but they require different tool proficiency and ability modifiers.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

ANCIENT TRADITION

The runes of the Giants, Dwarves, and other ancient traditions. Your ability modifier for this tradition is Wisdom, and you can select your related tool from Mason's Tools or Painter's Supplies.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

ACADEMIC TRADITION

The runes of mages, scholors, and elves, these traditions are not necessarily any less ancient, but runecarvers of these traditions seek new knowledge and expression, rather than being rooted in the old ways. Your ability modifier for this tradition is Intelligence, and you can select your related tool from Calligrapher's Supplies or Woodcarver's Tools.
### Layout: end frame

MATERIALS

Runecarving uses primarily magical ink and essences to imbue their runes with the prerequisite magical properties.

CRAFTING ROLL

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Puting that together means that when you would like to make a rune, your crafting roll is as follows based on your tradition:

Ancient Tradition Runecarver Modifier = your Mason's Tools or Painter's Supplies (your choice) proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

Academic Tradition Runecarver Modifier = your Calligrapher's Supplies or Woodcarver's Tools (your choice) proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
### Layout: end frame

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

After you make a crafting roll, if you succeed, you make 2hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item).

Checks for Runecarving do not need to be immediately consecutive. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged. Failure means that no progress is made during that time.

Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage.
### Layout: end frame

RUNECARVING SAVING THROW

Some runes require a saving throw, the following is the formula for calculating the saving throw. The saving throw is calculated at the time of creation based on the creators attributes and proficiency, and doesn't change once it is created. A saving throw doesn't include any expertise or other bonuses a crafter has to the crafting roll.

Rune DC = 8 + your related tool proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (based on your Tradition).

Rune Attack Roll Modifier = your related tool proficiency bonus + your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (based on Tradition).

PLACING A RUNE

You can place a rune a nonmagical weapon, set of armor, or item. When you place an rune on an item, that item requires attunement. When a creature is attuned to it, the rune grants the wielder certain benefits as defined by the rune. An item becomes a magical item of the rarity of the rune placed on it when a rune is palced on it

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

RUNES ON MAGICAL ITEMS

Placing a rune on a magical item is exceedingly difficult. Magical items resist modification, and their magic interfers with the rune. It can be done with additional difficult as per the table below. If the item has attunement, the rune still requires seperate attunement.

Engineering

ENGINEERING

Engineering is an academic art of turning labor and materials into grand creations. At its smallest scale, it is used for pratical applications like siege equipment, but scales up to building bridges, buildings, and even ships. An engineer is a deeply sought after resource for any lord or kingdom, but has knowledge that savvy adventurers can put to great use on occasion.

RELATED TOOL & ABILITY SCORE

Engineering uses carpenter's tools. Checks can be made with a substitute tool at your GM's discretion, but are made with disadvantage.

QUICK REFERENCE

The following is a quick reference to follow for each step of an engineering project:

 • Select the construction project you would like to begin.
 • Gather the required labor if necessary.
 • Ensure you have all materials for the construction project available.
 • Use your carpenter's tools to begin work, taking a number of hours listed in the crafting time column. You can make progress in 2 hours increments.
 • For each 2 hour increment, make a crafting check of 1d20 + your Intelligence modifier + your proficiency with carpenter's tools.
 • On success, you mark 2 hours of completed time. Once the completed time is equal to the crafting time, the construction project is complete. On failure, the crafting time is lost and no progress has been made during the 2 hours. If you fail three times in a row, the construction project is a failure and all materials are lost.

MATERIALS

BULK MATERIALS TABLE

X
Material	Price
Unit of Lumber	1 gp

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

HARVESTING TREES

You can convert trees that are at least 20 feet tall into units of lumber. A 20 foot tall tree will produce 1 unit of lumber, and an additional unit of lumber for each 10 feet of tree height. At your GM's discrection, some trees may not be suitable lumber. It takes 4 hours of work by a laborer to convert trees to units of lumber.

A unit of lumber can be converted to 10 common branches
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

QUARRYING STONE

Quarrying Stone is significantly harder and at the edge of what this system attempts to define. As a rule of thumb, if a quarry that can produce stone is available, 1 laborer can produce 1 unit of stone in 8 hours of hard labor (1 unit per day). A laborer with a Strength ability score of 18 or higher can produce twice as much stone in the same time period.

Setting up a quarry exceeds the scope of this system, but would take days or weeks.
### Layout: end frame

CRAFTING ROLL

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
When you would like to build an engineering project, it relies on your carpenter's tools, and the Intelligence to use them.

Engineering Modifier = your Carpenter’s Tools proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

SUCCESS AND FAILURE

After making a crafting roll, if you succeed, you make 2 hours of progress toward the total crafting time (and have completed one of the required checks for making an item).

Checks for Engineering do not need to be immediately consecutive. If you fail three times in a row, all progress and materials are lost and can no longer be salvaged. Failure means that no progress is made during that time.

Once an item is started, even if no progress is made, the components reserved for that item can only be recovered via salvage.
### Layout: end frame

LABOR

Unlike most crafting, Engineering can encompass large projects that require additional laborers. A laborer can be any creature with a Strength of 12 or higher that can understand you, lift and carry objects, and is willing to work for you for the duration. You can be your own laborer if you fit the requirements. A creature with a Strength of 18 or higher or proficiency with carpenter's tools can count as a skilled laborer, and is worth two laborers. Two creatures of insufficient Strength ability score but with 8 or more Strength ability score working together can be counted as single laborer, but only for 4 hours a day, after which more labor confers a level of exhaustion.

Additional labor doesn't inherently speed a project up, though a GM may rule that it is possible in a case by case basis. Checks can be made with insufficient labor as long as you have half the labor pool needed, but each crafting check takes 4 hours in this case.

The number of laborers required is based on the scale of the project, as per the following table:

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
X
Project Scale	Laborers Needed
Small	0
Medium	0
Large	1
Huge	2
Gargantuan (30x30)	3
Colossal (40x40+)	4+

### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

COLOSSAL PROJECTS

For colossal projects (projects bigger than Gargantuan), you need one laborer for every additional 10 square feet of the project beyond 40 by 40. For example, to build a bridge that is 200 feet long by 40 feet wide, you would need five times more laborers (20 laborers) to maintain a 2 hour crafting check.

Every laborer requires their own set of crafting tools, though they do not need proficiency with them. At a GM’s discretion, mason’s tools or woodcarver’s tools can replace carpenter’s tools for laborers where appropriate.

Minor Branches

MINOR BRANCHES

Some branches of crafting tend to overlap with the needs of adventurers more than others. The ones that do not are listed here as minor branches. These are no less important to a world and an economy, but provide more basic necessities, materials, and valuable goods. The primary use of these branches of crafting are to produce valuable goods.

One common interaction with these branches of crafting is with enchanting-magic has expensive taste, and it might be hard to find, for example, boots worth 250 gp-those are some fancy boots! You can use these branches of crafting to make or calculate how such things might be made.

The following provides tool and ability score for each minor branch of crafting, as well as some examples of materials and produced items, but keep in mind that minor branches exist primarily for value added crafting, the provided examples are just reference points (instances) of the value added formula.

Brewing primarily the art of fermenting things into alcoholic substances, most often forms of ales. While of little practical use, it is an art of personal enthusiasm for many of the adventuring sorts and layfolk of the world.

Brewing Time

While brewing only takes a few hours, common beer takes 3 days to ferment, and fancier ones may take weeks or months. As a very simple rule of thumb:

 • Beer worth less than 5 gp a barrel takes 3 days.
 • Beer worth more than 5 gp takes 2 weeks.
 • Achohol takes 3 days, with the 2 checks made at the start, after which the ahcohol can be collected after the brewing time.
 • Particularly fancy or exotic beverages may take longer; up to months

JEWELCRAFTING

The art of making jewelry of all forms, from cutting gems, setting them, or creating fine metal works.

Why Weaver’s Tools?

Because that’s what the default system has. While I could invent a new tool, as much as possible I want to keep this compatible with the basic system, including backgrounds and proficiency. If a player wants to tailor things and consults the core books, they’ll pick weaver’s tools, so I want that to work as they’d expect

APPENDIX A: CALCULATING NEW ITEMS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
This book is not a book about magic items, and the subject of how to make an item is beyond the scope of the appendix. This appendix will help you figure out how to craft an item you've already made. The first thing you need to know is the rarity of the item and if the item is consumable or not.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
XXX
Rarity	Difficulty	Time	Estimated Labor Cost
Common	8-12	2-8 hours	0.1-16 gp
Uncommon	12-15	4-16 hours	8-144 gp
Rare	15-18	8-24 hours	72-912 gp
Very Rare	17-20	16-40 hours	3,760-3,980 gp
Legendary	20-25	24-40 hours	2,388-44,140 gp

### Layout: end frame

Regardless if the item is consumable or not, it should generally fall into those ranges. Consumable items should fall to the bottom of the range, while more mechanically powerful items should fall into the highest reaches. That the labor cost of an easy to make Legendary Item can be cheaper than Very Rare items is intentional; the range of item cost and difficulty is very wide within rarities, even if the final cost of the item will result in them being ordered by rarity.

The next step is to add appropriate reagents of that the appropriate crafting branch of the rarity until you reach the following costs. The easiest way to do this will be to find a similar item that is already built out, and then replace any item that doesn't make sense of your item, or to increase or decrease the cost of the item as appropriate.

ENCHATING & MAGICAL ITEMS

The most complicated (and most common) use case is Enchanting. Not only does enchanting use the basic components of its system, it adds an additional element: Scrolls. Scrolls serve as the "magic blueprint" to an item, and replace the rule of recipes or blueprints in the system. If your magic item cast spells... this step is easy. The item takes the scrolls of those spells.

If it doesn't, find appropriate allegories to what the item does. The obvious example, is a +1 weapon. It doesn't cast a spell, but it does have the same effect as a magic weapon spell, so it can use that scroll. A bag of holding is more complicated, but you can follow the same logic-the secret chest spell doesn't exactly overlap, but it shares some properties... it's close enough for these purposes.

The following is the labor cost table that drives the math of the system. You do not need actually use this to calculate your items, a rough estimation will suffice. This is provided for information purposes only.

OLD SCHOOL

Experience-based crafting

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
In the olden days crafting checks took experience as a fundamentally component. This is not a feature of this sytem, but the following is a variant for those that want to run a hateful and archaic system that will cause great suffering. In this system, certain components can be (or must, as per your GM), be replaced with experience, using the following ratios:
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

### Layout: end frame

Arcanist Crafting

This harkens back to the tales of the Arcanists of certain ancient empires investing their very life force and power in magic items, and somewhat models the system as presented in early editions. I don't necessarily recommend it for 5e, and this isn't how I run crafting, but I wouldn't to present the option here. This will make magic items more of an investment, but easier to access.

ASSISTANCE

Group-based crafting and minions

When being assisted by a skilled craftsman (who has proficiency in the related tool and skills of the crafting branch), you gain advantage on the crafting roll.

If one roll succeeds, the check passes and the crafting continues as normal. If both of your rolls succeed, it counts as twice as much progress. If both of the rolls would be a failure, it counts as two failures and no progress is made. Too many cooks in a kitchen can be dangerous! More than one helper when crafting this method doesn't have additional benefits.

If you are using the "Take 10" approach during downtime crafting, you can pick the most skilled crafter's modifier to the crafting roll to use. Each additional person assisting during downtime crafting, the period crafting time per check is reduced by 1 hour to a minimum of 1 hour (with three helpers). People can only qualify as helpers if they have proficiency in the tool being used for the crafting project.

ACTUAL BLACKSMITHING

Actual blacksmiths have opinions

Since posting this system, I've heard from plenty of actual blacksmiths, letting me know blacksmithing is hard. This system is a model that balances game mechanics, fun, practicality, and realism in equal parts, but if you want a system that will make them happier, double all blacksmithing times, and triple armor crafting time per check. This means that making 1 check would for weapons or items would be 4 hours, and making 1 check for armor would take 6 hours.

I would recommend only using this variant when downtime is plentiful, or when combined with the "Assistance" variant rules. When combined with the assistance variant rules, the maximum number of helpers remains 3 (each reducing the time to make a check by 1 hour still).

MORE COMMON MAGIC

Not just for enchanters

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
While magical items is generally thought of as the domain of enchanters, a skilled crafter with the correct knowledge may be able to craft certain magic items with this variant rule. If you have proficiency in Arcana, you can use your crafting skill to craft items from certain enchanting tables as per the table below. When making items this way, you can only make items of types you can normally make.

If another creature proficient in arcana assists for the full duration of the craft, they can serve as a replacement for proficiency in arcana.

CRAFTING SKILL

Artisanal skills that aren’t tied to how good at slaying monsters you happen to be

This is an alternative to using proficiency. This was theoriginal plan, but ultimately proved unnecessarily complicated for general use, but some people prefer the sense of progression and realism from having a crafting skill that isn't tied to your combat prowess.

PROGRESSION AND PROGRESS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Each branch of crafting will have a different way to gain skill in that field, typically involving a variety of options for gaining each level of a skill. These are not intended to be something gained easily or quickly, and scale on a quite exponential scale. Achieving skill 3 or 4 is fairly easy for adventurers, while skill 5 and 6 would be what is achieved at the end game, and level 7 is possible, but out of reach for most adventurers. Here is a simple method of progression:
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
XXXX
Skill	Gold Pieces of Items Created
1	10 gp
2	100 gp
3	1,000 gp
4	10,000 gp
5	100,000 gp
6	1,000,000 gp
7	10,000,000 gp

### Layout: end frame

If you combine with the innovation system, you can award double credit for any gold pieces of materials spent attempting to innovate a new item when tracking skill progression.

INNOVATION SYSTEM

Making it so you have to actually know how to make the things you make

Adding back in some complexity Almost all enchanting recipes use scrolls as blueprints for the magic of the item and essences to power it. It is possible that other methods exist, the scroll is fundamentally a blueprint of the magic the item uses, as well part of its magical essence that is imbued into it. A GM can opt to replace the scroll with a blueprint or innovation check (see variant rules) and additional magical essences (to replace both the knowledge and power provided by the scroll).

VARIANT: RECIPES

Materials are just stuff without a recipe. Coming in the form of techniques, blueprints, or any one of a hundred different forms of knowledge, the an essential step of making anything is know how.

A recipe alone doesn't inherently grant success-a recipe is just a path that the craftsman can walk, but final product will come down to their skills, materials, and a little luck. Even so, recipes are not created equal. The technique of swordcraft left behind by a grand master of the craft can contain knowledge that will inherently boost the skills of anyone following its techniques.

Like materials, recipes can come from three sources.

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Found: The world you adventure in is often vast and dotted with the legacies of those that have come before. Frequently ancient techniques and secrets can be uncovered during your adventurers, hoarded by dragons (...or maybe kobolds earlier in your adventures!).

Purchased: As with most things, money can bridge many gaps and provide many answers. Either convincing a craftsman to teach you their technique or buying a potion formula from the alchemists guild, most people in the world will understand that they stand to more to gain by selling fish than by teaching their customers how to fish, so these will won't come cheap, but can often by attained by establishing good relations... or just dropping a lot of coin.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
How Much Do Recipes Cost?

How much a recipe costs, or even if it's available, has a lot of factors behind it and is ultimately up to the GM, but in general be fairly expensive (to encourage innovation) but not outrageous compared to what they make. Roughly 10 times the cost of the materials to make the item.
### Layout: end frame

Invented: While many craftsmen and craftswoman tread in the footsteps of others, those at the cutting edge are those that innovate and invent, stepping beyond what is known (to them). More difficult, a recipe is created through trial and effort, and will frequently leave many broken prototypes as proof of the effort.

To invent a recipe, you make an innovation check. This takes 1 hour, and once attempted cannot be attempted again until you finish a long rest. You can select materials to expend on the innovation check.

 • If you roll half the innovation difficult or more and did not have the correct materials, you learn the materials needed for the recipe (this doesn't require any materials to be expended).
 • If you roll half the innovation difficult or more of the recipe and had the correct ingredients, you learn the innovation difficulty of the recipe and materials needed for the recipe.
 • If you roll the innovation difficult with all the required ingredients spent toward the check, you learn the recipe, and this counts as the first successful crafting roll toward crafting the product of that recipe.
 • On failure, all materials put toward the check are lost. On success, the recipe is learned, and the materials can be rolled over toward crafting the item; the first crafting check for the item automatically succeeds on that crafting attempt.

The GM can set the innovation DC of an item, or just have it default to the DC of an innovation check is the Crafting DC of the item +5.

An innovation roll is as follows:

Recipe Innovation Roll = d20 + your relevant crafting Skill + your Wisdom or Intelligence modifier (your choice)

However a player has acquired their recipes, they are encouraged to record their recipes in a book or manual.

Losing Your Recipes:

Recipes are usually going to be recorded as physical documents, and consequently must be safeguarded. If a set of Recipes are lost, it will be up to the GM to determine how many they might remember by heart.

The following is my recommendation: half their recipes + the intelligence modifier are known by heart. Recipes remembered are chosen in the order of Invented Recipes &gt; Most Crafted Recipe &gt; Most Recently Crafted Recipe, and then ordered by which have been used the most to the least.

Certain feats or abilities may negate any recipes lost.

GRITTY REALISM

For games that move at a more deliberate pace

The normal crafting time listed in this book is balanced around a progression of minimal downtime with 8 hour long rests. For games that follow the model of 8 hour short rests and week long long rests offering more downtime, you can still use this system, but may want to consider longer crafting checks.

To accomplish this, make each crafting check take 8 hours (four times longer). This maps to one work day per crafting check. In addition:

 • Checks do not have to be subsequent for any crafting branch (including alchemy).
 • Taking 10 for checks takes two consecutive workdays.
 • Gathering checks require one week when gathering from environment.

tocchapterAppendix E

APPENDIX E: EXOTIC MATERIALS

EXOTIC INGREDIENTS & POTIONS

While standard potions are made from curative, reactive, or poisonous ingredients, exotic ingredients have specialized effects. When making a potion from these ingredients, the potions effect is a combination of the effect of the exotic ingredients added.

An Exotic Potion (potion brewed entirely from exotic ingredients) doesn't need a recipe and has a crafting time of 1 hour, and a difficulty of the difficulty of all the exotic ingredients used added together, with 1 check needed per exotic ingredient added.

An exotic ingredients can be combined with a standard potion by adding the DC of the standard potion to the combined difficulty of the exotic ingredients. This can result in very powerful potions, but will frequently result in unattainable high difficulty to make it work, as adding random new components to potions typically wrecks the effect.

EXOTIC EFFECTS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

APPLE OF ARBOREA

Legendary, Exotic, Difficulty +6

Consuming this apple has the effect of greater restoration cast upon the person that consumes it. If the creature that consumes it is Good aligned, they gain the benefit of death ward until they finish a long rest.

Adding it to a potion makes that potion confer the effects of
eating it, but has no alignment restrictions.

CATFERN

Common, Exotic, Difficult +1

A light and airy fern that tends to get easily caught in the wind and slightly glows.

When added to any potion you consume, you gain 30 feet of darkvision for the duration of the potion effect. If you already have darkvision, the range of your darkvision increases by 30 feet for the duration of the effect.

When added to a Potion of Climbing, it also grants you a climbing speed equal to your walking speed in addition to its normal effects.

DRAGONGRASS

Common, Exotic, Difficulty +2

This is a strange grass that burns very hot and tastes terrible.

When added to a Potion of Fire Breath, it allows you to replace one or more breaths with breathing fire in a cone with the effect of the spell burning hands.

When added to a Custom Potion that would deal damage to a target area, it allows you to instead drink the potion and breath of a 15-foot cone of the damaging effect the potion would have had
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)

BASILISK EYE

Common, Exotic, Difficulty +3

At first glance, it looks like a stone.

When this and 1 common divine essence is added to any healing potion, that healing potion also removes the Petrified condition when used.

GARGOYLE'S HEART

Common, Exotic, Difficulty +3

A gem like heart that forms inside gargoyles that have been animated for a certain number of years.

When you add this to a potion, any creature that consumes the potion develops are tough rock-like skin. Their AC can't be less than 16, regardless of what kind of armor they are wearing, and they become immune to critical strikes. These effects fade when the effects of the potion fade, or last 1 hour if the potion would otherwise not have duration.

MIMIC HEART

Common, Exotic, Difficulty +2

This strange ever shifting fleshy organ has potent shifting
properties that can make the following Exotic Potions.

When added to a Potion of Climbing, it turns it into a Potion
of Alter Self, granting the effect of the spell alter self for 1
hour (no concentration required).

When added to a Potion of Growth along with at least one
other rare reactive ingredient, it becomes a Potion of
Polymorph granting the effect of the polymorph spell for 10
minutes (no concentration required)

APPENDIX F: CAMP ACTIONS

### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Camp Actions are things you can do during a long rest that make the most of your time-while adventurers need their beauty sleep (well, most of them), there's always a few spare hours during a Long Rest you can spend in one of the following ways to better prepare yourself for the harrowing times to come.

A long rest is 8 hours long, and most adventurers need 6 hours of sleep. This leaves 2 hours of light activity in which to take a camp action from the following list.
### Layout: end frame
### Layout: begin half-width frame (Body Text style)
Elves, Constructs, and More

Some 5e races have unique sleep requirements. They consequently spend less of their time sleeping or sleep in unique ways. They can take the "Take a Watch" action as many times as they have available time for after taking care of whatever resting needs they have, but may take only one other Camp Action while gaining the benefits of a long rest.
### Layout: end frame

TAKE A WATCH

Adventuring is dangerous, and adventurers often decide to long rest in strange places-sometimes it's best to set a watch.

CRAFT

An adventurer that takes this action can make 2 hours of progress toward Crafting during a long rest. This progress is made at the end of the long rest. In order to take this action, the adventurer must have the related crafting tools on hand.

Requires a campfire, and any Wisdom Perception checks during this time are made with disadvantage.

COOK

A special form of the crafting Camp Action that can be taken with cook's utensils. A hearty meal sits better than any trail rations... even when it is cooked from the simplest of ingredients. You and all willing creatures (willing to eat your cooking) regain an additional Hit Die from the long rest when it is finished.

If you have proficiency with cook's utensils, creatures regain additional Hit Dice equal to your proficiency bonus.

Requires a campfire, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks during this time are made with disadvantage

PREPARE

The life of an adventure has many challenges and it is only natural a cautious adventurer would want to prepare for them. Select one ability score to prepare for the upcoming day and perform 2 hours of an activity that hones it for the challenges ahead (you could prepare Strength or Dexterity through stretches or exercises, Intelligence through studying, Wisdom through meditation, etc).

After you finish the long rest, you gain a Preparation die, starting at as a d6. Each time you make an ability check related to your chosen ability score, roll the Preparation die and add it to the result. The Preparation die decreases by one step each time it is rolled until depleted (d6, d4, d2, depleted) May require a campfire, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks during this time are made with disadvantage.

SLUMBER

Sometimes a hard day of adventuring deserves a little extra shut eye. Taking this Camp Action is more akin to a camp inaction, and you get the full recommended 8 hours of sleep. During this deep slumber, automatically fail Wisdom (Perception) checks and your passive Perception is 0, however you reduce any levels of Exhaustion by 2 and awake with 1 inspiration.

Requires a campfire, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks during this time are made with disadvantage.

TASK

Sometimes you will have a task that requires your time, but doesn't fit into the above options. For example, copying spells to your spell book as a wizard. When engaging in such a task, you can replace your Camp Action with making 2 hours of progress toward that task.

May require a campfire, and any Wisdom (Perception) checks during this time are made with disadvantage.

APPENDIX M: CRAFTING MAGIC & ITEMS

CRAFTING MAGIC SPELLS

Crafting magic is a unique kind of utilitarian magic. Almost always ritual based, it is not intended for use in combat, and comes with some special rules. In most games, crafting magic spells will not count against spells known, but can only be learned by being taught or purchased, perhaps known from a background.

These spells exist for GMs to award to players to make it easier to use crafting-they are not required, but help integrate crafting into adventuring, and fulfill a narrative niche. Though these spells are arcane spells that are primarily the domain of Wizards and Inventors, a GM can assign them to any player they would make sense for (for example, perhaps a Cleric who follows a god of craft, creation, or forging).

1st-level transmutation (ritual)

Classes: Inventor, Wizard 
Casting Time: 1 minute 
Range: 15 feet

Duration: Concentration, up to 8 hours

A Medium-sized fire within range, such as a campfire, burns with unnatural heat within its embers for the duration. It gives off intense heat, dealing twice as much damage to any creature that takes damage from it and consumes materials twice as fast as normal. For the duration, it can serve as a forge to smelt nonmagical metals, and counts as a forge for the purposes of blacksmithing.

This spell creates an invisible, mindless, shapeless, Medium force that performs simple tasks at your command until the spell ends. The crafter springs into existence in an unoccupied space on the ground within range. It has AC 10, 1 hit point, and a Strength of 2, and it can't attack. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends.

Once on each of your turns as a bonus action, you can mentally command the crafter to move up to 15 feet and interact with an object. The crafter can perform simple tasks that a human servant could do, such as fetching things, cleaning, mending, folding clothes, lighting fires, serving food, and pouring wine. Additionally, it can perform skilled crafting checks. It always uses the taking 10 rule for crafting checks, completing one check every 4 hours. Its crafting modifier is +5. When you summon it, you can summon it with one artisan tool of your choice, which only it can use. It can use any other artisan tools otherwise available. If you cast this spell again while the crafter still exists, the previous one vanishes.

Once you give the command, the servant performs the task to the best of its ability until it completes the task, then waits for your next command. If you command the servant to perform a task that would move it more than 60 feet away from you, the spell ends.

At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, its crafting modifier increases by 1.
