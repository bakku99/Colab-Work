## Marked by the Gods
Due to your pact with the god of death, you are vulnerable to radiant damage and resistant to necrotic damage. This trait is always active unless suppressed by another feature.

## Unholy Aptitude
As an action, you can sense corpses and undead within 60 feet, even if they are obscured or covered. You can use this ability a number of times equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Leech’s Potency
You have a pool of life-steal energy equal to five times your Othys' Templar level. As an action, you can place a hand on a creature to drain hit points, up to the amount remaining in your pool. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw, taking half the amount drained on a failed save and none on a success. You still regain the drained hit points. You can also expend 5 hit points from the pool to inflict the poisoned condition on a target that isn’t immune.

## Spellcasting
Your devotion grants limited spellcasting drawn solely from the school of necromancy.
- **Cantrips:** Spare the Dying is always prepared and doesn’t count against your number of cantrips known.
- **Preparing Spells:** You can prepare a number of necromancy spells equal to your Othys' Templar level + your Wisdom modifier. If you gain access to spells from other schools (such as through multiclassing or feats), you cast those spells with disadvantage. If the spell does not normally require a roll to cast, then you must make a Wisdom Saving Throw. The DC is equal to your Spell Save DC - Proficiency Bonus. On a success, you cast the spell. On a failure, the spell fails, and you lose the spell slot.
- **Spellcasting Ability:** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability.
- **Spell Save DC:** 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier.

## Reaper’s Link
*2nd-level feature.* As an action, you can attempt to link your soul with a creature you can see up to a range of 90 feet. The target makes a Wisdom saving throw (with disadvantage if its Intelligence is 7 or lower). On a failure, it becomes linked. While linked, your damage dice against that creature are doubled, and critical hits quadruple your damage dice. You take half of the damage you deal (including critical extra damage). You can dismiss the link as a bonus action. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

## Drainer’s Student
*2nd-level feature.* When you make a melee attack, you deal half damage but gain hit points equal to the damage dealt. This feature cannot be used while Reaper's Link is active.

## Adept at Death
*2nd-level feature.* If damage would reduce you to 0 hit points before your next turn, you instead drop to 1 hit point and lose your bonus action. You immediately make a death saving throw. On a success you are stable; on a failure you die. If stabalized or revived, you gain one level of specialized exhaustion, removed only by dealing 25 points of damage through Reaper’s Link. If you are under the effect of the Death Ward spell, then you do not receive a level of specialized exhaustion.

## Friend of Decay
*3rd-level feature.* You have advantage on saving throws against magical or mundane disease.

## Irreverent Curse
*3rd-level feature.* You choose a curse path at 3rd level that grants features at 3rd, 7th, 12th, and 17th level. Each curse provides associated spells and a Provoke Profanity ability. (See “Curse Options” below.)

### Curse Spells
Each curse lists spells that are always prepared for you and don’t count against your number of prepared spells. All curse spells are necromancy spells for you.

### Provoke Profanity
Your curse grants profane abilities described in its entry. You can use a Provoke Profanity once and regain expended uses after a short or long rest. Saving throws use your spell save DC.

## Ability Score Improvement
At 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You cannot increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Alternatively, you may choose one feat.

## Extra Attack
*5th-level feature.* You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Shadow Glide
*7th-level feature.* You can use a bonus action to briefly meld with shadows, gaining a flying speed equal to your walking speed until the end of the current turn. If you end your turn in the air without clinging to a surface, you fall. Moving in dim light or darkness this way doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks.

## Death Walker
*10th-level feature.* Friendly undead and their controllers within 10 feet of you gain a bonus to attack rolls equal to your proficiency bonus. You also gain darkvision that pierces magical darkness within 60 feet.

## Improved Reaper’s Link
*11th-level feature.* Damage you suffer from Reaper’s Link is reduced to one-quarter of the damage dealt, rounded up.

## Otherworldly Rejuvenation
*14th-level feature.* As an action, you can destroy an undead creature within 15 feet (it must fail a Wisdom saving throw if hostile) and regain hit points equal to the undead’s remaining hit points. Once used, you must finish a long rest to use this feature again.

## Creature of Darkness
*18th-level feature.* You can cast **darkness** at will without expending a spell slot.

## Homebrew Spells
The following new spells are referenced in the class features and curses:

- **Binding Punishment (2nd-level, bonus action, 60 ft., Concentration 1 minute, Str save):** Binds up to two creatures with spectral chains that deal necrotic damage when any bound creature is harmed. Each creature must make a Strength Saving Throw. Both creatures must fail the Saving Throw for the effect to take place; if either, or both, creatures succeed the Saving Throw, then the spell fails. If both Saving Throws are failed, then both creatures take 1d4 necrotic damage + your spellcasting modifier. For the duration of the spell, spectral chains appear between the bound creatures, which harmlessly pass through solid objects and creatures. If a bound creature is damaged from a source other than this spell, all other creatures bound by the same casting of this spell take 1d4 necrotic damage + your spellcasting modifier. A creature can only take damage in this way once per round.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 2nd. If targeting more than two creatures, at least two creatures must fail the Saving Throw, or the spell fails.
- **Graveyard (2nd-level, action, 90 ft/20‑ft square, Concentration 1 minute, Str save):** Skeletal hands burst up from the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within range. When casting this spell, the caster may choose any number of creatures for the skeletal hands to ignore. For the duration, these hands turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain. A creature that enters the area of this spell for the first time on its turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be grappled by the grasping hands until the spell ends and takes 1d4 necrotic damage at the beginning of each of its turns. A creature grappled by the hands may use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself. If a creature casts a necromancy spell on a creature within the area of this spell, the caster gains 5 temporary hit points. When the spell ends, the skeletal hands disappear into the ground. 
At Higher Levels. When casting this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the area of the spell increases by 10 ft. for each level above 2nd.
- **Black Flame Armor (1st-level, action, self, 1 minute):** After casting this spell, a shroud of dark flames wreathes your body. For the spell’s duration, any creature within 5 feet of you that touches or strikes you with an unarmed or melee  weapon attack takes an amount of necrotic damage equal to 1d4 + your spellcasting ability modifier. 
At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the amount of necrotic damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st.
- **Deathwish (4th-level, bonus action, 120 ft):** A creature you can see within 120 feet gains temporary hit points equal to your maximum hit points. This spell cannot stack with itself. If the creature already has temporary hit points, then the amount they gain because of this spell cannot exceed your maximum hit points. You gain two levels of exhaustion. Exhaustion levels gained by casting this spell are considered standard.
- **Endure (5th-level, action, 60 ft, concentration 1 minute):** Choose a willing creature you can see within range; it ceases to heed the pained calls of its body, needing neither food nor water to exist. An affected creature ignores the effects of exhaustion, the poisoned condition, and cannot be incapacitated, stunned, paralyzed, or fall unconscious. Each time an affected creature takes damage that would reduce its hit points to 0, it makes a death saving throw instead. If the creature fails 3 death saving throws while this spell is active, it dies.
When the spell ends, the creature gains a level of exhaustion for each death saving throw it failed. If the creature is resurrected after dying from these failed death saving throws, it does not regain consciousness for until 1 hour has passed. When it wakes, it gains 3 levels of exhaustion.
If the creature is still alive when the spell ends, it becomes lethargic for one round.
- **Bloody Wager (1st-level, bonus action, touch):** You point at a creature and make a wager with death, then touch a friendly creature to heal. Immediately take 1d6 necrotic damage as your wager. This damage cannot be reduced, mitigated, or shared in any way. If the creature you gambled upon dies before the end of your next turn your target heals 2d6 + your spellcasting modifier hit points.
If the target does not die before the end of your next turn, you lose the bet and the spell ends with no further effects.
At Higher Levels. When cast at 2nd level or higher, for each spell level higher than 1st, increase the initial damage done to the caster by 1d6 and the healing done on target death by 2d6.
- **Blood Siphon (2nd-level, action, 60 ft, Concentration 1 minute, Con save):** A stream of blood flows forth from an enemy within 60 feet and connects to the caster, or a friendly creature within 60 feet of the enemy. The stream drains 2d6 worth of HP in necrotic damage per turn to the enemy, and heals 2d6 + your spellcasting modifier Hit Points to the friendly party. The stream acts as a tether for the spells effect and can be broken by walls and obstacles, but as long as the caster is still concentrating on the spell, the tether will reappear once there are no obstacles blocking the streams path, and the distance is no greater than 60 feet. If the tether is blocked at the start of the caster's turn, then the spell ends. This spell has no greater effects at higher levels.
- **Ally Restore (4th-level, bonus action, 30 ft):** Up to six allies choose to heal 2d4 + your spellcasting modifier, end a Charmed, Frightened, or Poisoned condition, cure a disease, or gain temporary hit points equal to 2d4 + your spellcasting modifier. 
At Higher Levels. When using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, each creature healed regains an additional 2d4 hit points per spell slot higher than 4th, each creature removing a condition can remove an additional condition per each spell slot higher than 4th, each creature removing a disease regains 2d4 hit points per each spell slot higher than 4th, and each creature gaining temporary hit points gains an additional 5 temporary hit points per each spell slot higher than 4th.
- **Accelerated Recovery (5th-level, action, sight):** Heals 40 hit points and cures blindness, deafness, or disease, but the target suffers one level of exhaustion. This spell has no effect on constructs, but it does effect Undead.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a slot of 6 level or higher, the amount of healing increases by 10 for each slot above 5. 
- **Animate Shadow (1st-level, action, 60 ft, Concentration 1 minute, Wis save):** You bring to life the shadow of a creature you can see within range. The target must make a wisdom save against your spell save DC or their shadow animates into a malevolent attacker. For the spells duration the shadow stays attached to the target, sharing it's space and constantly assailing the target, granting advantage on all attacks against it. In addition, the shadow deals 1d6 necrotic damage at the beginning of each of the targets turns. At the end of each turn, the target can attempt a Wisdom Saving Throw to dispel the shadow and end the effect.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a slot of 2nd or higher, the amount of damage increased by 1d6 for each slot above 1st.
- **Achroma (9th-level, action, 60 ft, Con save):** With a whisper, you imprint a vision from an otherworldly plane of existence onto the mind of a creature within range, forcing it to comprehend the incomprehensible vista. The target creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 12d10 necrotic damage and is incapacitated for the duration of the spell. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and is not incapacitated.
If damage caused by this spell reduces the target to 0 hit points, it immediately fails all of its death saving throws and becomes an achromatic husk. As it “dies” over the course of 3 days, the target calmly crouches or lays down and stares blankly at nothing. Its color desaturates until it is only shades of gray and its body begins to flake like a log turning to ash in a fire. Though dead, the achromatic husk continues to mindlessly speak and begs for assistance, claiming to be experiencing a terrible, burning thirst.
A secondary creature suffers 4d6 collateral necrotic damage if it touches or attempts to aid the achromatic husk in any way, including casting ranged spells on it. The secondary creature is only aware of receiving the collateral damage once it disengages from the achromatic husk or when it has been damaged twice, whichever occurs first. A secondary creature whose hit points are reduced to 0 by this spell's collateral effects also immediately fails all its death saving throws and becomes an achromatic husk. The collateral damage trigger lasts for one round with one exception mentioned below.
The achromatic husk condition is not a curse or other common status effect and cannot be removed via normal restorative magics. The creature can be restored only by means of a true resurrection or wish spell, during which the caster suffers one instance of the above described 4d6 collateral necrotic damage while performing the spell. If successfully resurrected, the creature's recovery from the ordeal of dying takes twice as long as usual, and it suffers fitful nightmares until fully restored. The creature remains permanently colorless.
- **Corpse Bomb (1st-level, action, 120 ft, Dex save):** The corpse of a recently deceased creature rapidly bloats at your command and erupts in a gruesome explosion. You target the corpse of a creature that's been dead for no longer than 1 minute that you can see within range, detonating it. Each creature within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on that corpse must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 2d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The size of the explosion increases by 5 feet for every size larger than medium.
At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.
- **Shadow Step (4th-level, action, 300 ft):** You seep into the shadows becoming invisible for up to 1 full round if desired. You may choose to teleport anywhere there is a shadow or darkness within 300 feet upwards, downwards, or any other type of configuration. You do not have to see the spot as long as you can visualize or describe it. If you choose a spot that is occupied, you may attempt to swap places with the creature by pulling them through the shadows to where you once were. If the creature is unwilling, they must succeed a Strength Saving Throw or be forcibly teleported by the shadows to where you once stood, and you take their place. If they succeed, then you take 4d6 force damage and fail to teleport.
